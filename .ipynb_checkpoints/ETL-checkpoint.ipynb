       " 'text': ['No you can find this kind of a tree in the forest. (source:\\xa0xkcd) While it might not get you invited to parties, it is important to know what a tree is to jump into the Merkle Tree. In computer science, a tree is a data structure. What it means is; It is composed out of\\xa0nodes: a fancy way of saying something that contains data and can link to other fellow nodes.It is also composed out of\\xa0edges: which is the links we were talking about in the previous point. Duh.It is a type of\\xa0graph: if you only have the previous two points and no other limitations imposed on it; you would have a graph. However, since trees are special types of graphs;It starts with a\\xa0root node: You must have one node that is the beginning of your tree, where it all began. Your very own patient zero. (Someone remind me to make a zombie joke here please.)Nodes only link by\\xa0branching off\\xa0of the parent nodes. As such, you can just link your nodes however you want.A node without children is called a\\xa0leaf\\xa0or\\xa0terminal. When you follow these six rules; you end up with something like the following: A tree in the wild. Let not spook it. (source:\\xa0wikipedia) I can almost hear everyone screaming at their screens and chanting  what? In my opinion it is best to give a relevant example such as an organisation hierarchy. You see, even though we defined a computer science term with nodes, leafs and such it is actually not something we have never seen. Any time we think of a hierarchy, and strictly the hierarchy, we think of a tree. An example of a organisational hierarchy. See how they are the same? (source: me) As it turns out, this type of a data structure that we knew even before computer science, has many different use cases. Particularly speaking it is commonly used for representing hierarchical data, since it has a certain structure storing data for efficient searches and more. A\\xa0merkle tree\\xa0is just a special type of tree. And also another use case for this data structure with additional limitations. You see, in a\\xa0merkle tree, which is also known as a\\xa0hash tree, every\\xa0leaf\\xa0contains When a man and a woman loves each other very much Sorry that was not the topic we are on. A\\xa0hash\\xa0is basically a signature of any kind of arbitrary data. In a bit more formal way, it is a function that takes an arbitrary size data and returns a fixed size one.  However, since it is a  of the data it has to be; Deterministic: This basically means that we want to get the same hash for the same data. Forever. As such, you can have anything random here.Uniform: If we had a function, that yelled  for any input, it would so far work right?  However in order to have this as a good, unique signature we want the chance of getting any output (of the fixed size) roughly the same. If this doesn happen we have more of what is called a\\xa0collision: meaning that we have more and more data with the same signature.  With large enough  output (signature size) and uniformity, this stops being a problem, especially for data that has any meaning Defined range: This is the  part that we are talking about.  Since our goal is taking any data and producing a common signature, it has to have a defined range. This is usually talked as the amount of bits, so a very popular hash function SHA-512 for example has 512-bit as its defined range.Non-invertible: We expect these signatures to be a one way street, meaning you shouldn be able to get the original content using the hash.  While this is not always a requirement, especially for cryptographic hashes, it is definitely very important. (Meaning for example instead of storing your password, facebook could store the  of the password and not get into trouble previously) Since now we have an idea of what a hash is; back to the Merkle Tree. As we were saying, each\\xa0leaf\\xa0in this tree has some data block in it. Any other\\xa0node contains the\\xa0cryptographic hash (the one-way signature)\\xa0of its children. This turns out to be a very interesting way of storing some data; particularly because it allows you to verify any kind of data. It is also very good in making sure this is a fast process, since we only check for the signatures of the data and nothing else. A lovely little Merkle Tree. Say hi! (source:\\xa0wikipedia) But why? Couldn we just check the normal hash of the data instead of putting it into pieces and creating a whole tree? We could. However, if you are developing a distributed / peer-to-peer (where machines are talking to each other and you don know whom you can trust) systems, this type of a verification becomes extremely important. Even though the same data is in multiple places, there is no way of knowing if; The node you get the data from is honest.The data you get is correct (and the node before you wasn fooled).The data was not corrupted on the road. Ensuring these questions are answered reliably while also making the verifications fast is why we use Merkle Trees. There are many examples of this in the wild, particularly the source control system Git and the pseudo-anonymous cryptocurrency Bitcoin are the most notable ones known. As such, it is also a prerequisite to understanding what a blockchain is.

       "  'The steady growth in the crypto-asset space has increased the need and popularity of market intelligence/analytics products. However, like any other new asset class, the methodologies and techniques to extract meaningful intelligence about crypto-assets are going to take some time to mature. Fortunately, the crypto market was born in the golden age of data science and machine learning so it has a shot at building the most sophisticated generation of market intelligence products ever seen for an asset class. Paradoxically, it seems that we prefer to remain lazy and come up with half-baked analytics that have the mathematical rigor of a fifth grade class. The current wave of analytic products for crypto-assets are still very nascent and experimenting with all sorts of new ideas. However, there is a difference between experimentation and lack of rigor. Sadly, the crypto-market is constantly bombarded with outrageous claims from analytics providers that don require a PH.D in statistics to know they are flawed. Today, I would like to deep dive through some of the most common  analytics you might have read on research materials about crypto-assets. Analytics are hard and its construction is hard to understand by most people. As a result, it is easy to misinterpret a semi-complex analytics by robust ones. If to that, we add the fact that the behavior of crypto-assets remains an enigma to most investors, we have the perfect storm to produce fantasy analytics and ridiculous explanations about the crypto-markets. While the are no silver bullets to determine whether a specific metric or analysis for crypto-assets is relevant, there are a few tips that might help dissect signal from noise in this area: 1)\\xa0Crypto-Asset Specific:\\xa0The most effective metrics to evaluate the behavior of crypto-assets are, surprise-surprise, those that factor in elements that are specific to crypto and that have no equivalent in other asset classes. 2)\\xa0Regular Data Validation:\\xa0Look for metrics/signals that offer regular data validations proofs about their impact of correlation with price(if any). You will be surprised what you find ð\\x9f\\x98\\x8a. 3)\\xa0Human Relatable:\\xa0Crypto remains largely a retail investor market in which data is mostly free and available. Analytics and market metrics should mimic the demographic of the investor population and, in crypto, that means to have simple signals that normal people can understand. Complicated patterns in a market that we don quite understand yet is a recipe for disaster. Simple doesn only mean easy to understand but flexible to change and adapt to market changes. Like any other asset class in history, crypto-markets are full of speculation and propense to formulate theories without basics on real data. Without citing any specifics, I listed some of my favorite examples of misleading analytics for crypto asset. You might recognize some of those from different tools ð\\x9f\\x98\\x8a We all heard this before\\xa0 score combines 3 factors and is the perfect measure of the performance of a crypto-asset\\xa0When you dig a bit deeper into those market scores you realize that are simple weighted of a number of basic factors. The idea of analyzing a complex financial market with a single score is preposterous. Markets are based on complex, non-linear dynamics that involves tens of thousands of factors many of them unknown to us. Analyzing those complex dynamics requires combining factors in many ways for different periods of time. No score works for all assets throughout all market conditions. That fact is even more relevant in the case of crypto-markets that are completely irrational and immature. Next time a crypto-analytics vendor tries to sell you a score run for the door ð\\x9f\\x98\\x8a. Sentiment analysis of social feeds like Twitter or Telegram is another common metric in the crypto space. Certainly, intelligence from social data can reveal trends in specific crypto-assets but you really need to dig deeper. Using basic sentiment analysis APIs such as Watson Assistant for analyzing crypto-assets is just being lazy. News are different than Twitter, discussions about the SEC, China or a listing in Coinbase are different from a token sale. Not to mention the level of noise introduced in mainstream social channels such as Twitter or Telegram. In other to extract any meaningful intelligence about crypto-assets using social fees, we need custom deep learning models that are really tailored to the specifics of the market. Technical traders are an important element of any financial market and crypto is not the exception. However, regardless of what your favorite chartists say, technical has never been enough to understand any financial market and certainly not a nascent one like crypto. Crypto is a new asset class that requires new fundamentals Any technical analysis needs to be a complement of models based on the native characteristics of a crypto-asset such as network or ownership behavior. The wisdom of the crowds is playing a significant role on how we predict the outcome of specific events in society. In financial markets, crowdsourced human predictions are typically used as a complementary data point rather than as the core analysis. The reason is that crowdsourced predictions tend to be more effective when applied to isolated, statics events such as a political election than when used to predict constantly changing dynamics such as the ones seen in financial markets. Movements in financial markets are often describe by complex, non-linear relationships between large number of variables, not by subjective human opinions. In the case of crypto-assets, the idea of basing market predictions on crowdsourced human opinions is even more questionable given that all the information is relatively public and the market is so irrational that escapes the understanding of most of us. One of the cornerstones of factor investing models is that some factors will serve as predictors to other factors. Its very strange, almost illogical, to try to predict a factor using recursive formula based on the same factor. Well, not in the case of crypto. The market is certainly floated with ideas about prediction the price of Bitcoin using the price of Bitcoin. If you would like to determine the rigor behind those predictions ask your provider how much money are they investing using that strategy. The answer, almost certainly, will be zero. These are some of the most misleading metrics you will find in the current generation of crypto-asset analytics. Extracting meaningful intelligence from crypto-assets requires digging deeper into factors that are specific to this asset class.',\n",
       "  'I have decided that I want to become a person who trades bitcoin for a living. This is not a  to post, because I don know  to yet. (And for my web developer friends, this has nothing to do with web development.) But having seen all the info out there telling me it easy, and being a bit sceptical, I think it might make interesting story. Perhaps I learn that trading bitcoin really can be an alternative to working for the man. Or maybe I fail and everyone can have a good laugh at my expense. We will see. The dream My dream is that, with a few hours effort each day, I can increase my net worth by a percent or so, and do so reliably enough that I will no longer need a day job. My days will then be filled writing novels and tending to an ever-growing menagerie of marsupials. My next life. Animals not pictured. Thanks Patrick Fore on Unsplash. Since I at the age where I thinking about retirement (late thirties), I am approaching this endeavour with a minimal appetite for risk. Which means my first task is objectively proving that my dream is possible without trading real money. The plan I will approach this scientifically, using the gold standard of scientific inquiry: a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT). To generalise those that don know gist of the scientific method is to define a hypothesis, then test it (among a bunch of other steps). And specifically, to try and falsify that hypothesis. So everything I do must be an attempt to show that this isn possible. Hypothesis: it is possible to predict the future increase or decrease in the value of bitcoin against the USD based on previous price and volume data. The trial: I will make trades for one month (with fake money). I will have two controls. 1) a  and hold is, just buy bitcoin at the start of the month and hold it until the end of the month. 2) randomised buying/selling will pick a random time each day to buy, and a random time an hour or so later to sell. (I purposefully misusing the R in RCT to fit my plan.) I will keep a log of each trade (that probably goes without saying) and plot the charts on top of each other (I will post the charts in these weekly posts. I will post so many charts). I might do multiple random lines if I think that be useful. If using all my wit to buy and sell at the right time can out-perform either of my controls by 20%, then I will consider the hypothesis false and chuck in the towel. This will be failure that feels like success. Or maybe the other way around. (20% is just one of the many numbers I pulling out of my hat. This is, after all, still week one.) Getting started At the beginning of the week I knew almost nothing about the blockchain and which cryptocurrencies and  were out there; I was oblivious to the various trading platforms and even what a  is and how I get my money in one. And I am still oblivious. Because that not the order in which I want to go about this trial. I want to learn some trading fundamentals first, because I know once I jump in I get carried away and find it hard to go back to sitting in a lounge chair with a lump of thinly sliced tree in my hands. Information filtering There is a lot of information out there for those wishing to trade cryptocurrencies. I can consume it all, so I figured it worth being diligent about what I do and don consume. Early on in my one-week career as a crypto-trader, I based my selection of videos to watch on the number of views they had. During these formative days, I learned that there are a lot of people who have made some trades over a few months some success, and then made a video about it. Good for them. But I could put a thousand monkeys in front of a thousand bitcoin exchanges, and 500 would make a profit (of which 400 would go on to make a YouTube video about their  and implore their viewers to  THAT LIKE BUTTON Of course no one mentions they were trading in the second half of 2017 when the price of bitcoin went from $2,000 to $18,000 anyway (!). That a lot of rich monkeys. Here a great chart I came across yesterday. It as old as the hills and neatly generalises the phases of a bubble.  in a Bubble Rodrigue Let layer that over bitcoin (as many before me have done): a) holy crap the first part is a neat fit! b) where oh where is the\\xa0despair? That peak is just around the end 2017. Merry Christmas. If someone wants to show me how they made money in crypto starting in early 2018 I all ears. So, I have decided to ignore any videos with a thumbnail sporting a fist-full of cash and a person screaming at me Raaaaar, like a\\xa0tiger  and to instead find out what professional stock traders read, and then see if that applies to crypto (I feel so cool abbreviating it like that). I now have Investopedia on hand at all times to get my head around the lingo. It confirmed that what I will be doing (reading charts) is called  analysis Investopedia also had a nice list of books to read. Here is where my first loss occurred: I bought Getting Started in Technical Analysis by Jack Schwagger for $15. I know they say that you shouldn judge a book by how cool the author name sounds, but I only human. Anyhoo, I bought this book for Kindle and have a hot tip for you: don buy any stock trading book you going to be looking at a lot of charts Kindle. This book is like  the pattern in the chart in figure 1.8 But figure 1.8 isn on the current page, no no! It like, 8 pages ahead, so then I swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe. And then think what am I supposed to be noticing about this chart? So I go back. Swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe\\xa0 is this far enough? Nope. So I swipe, swipe, swipe some more. I got about ten pages (and 140 swipes) into the book before I grew concerned I was going to wear through the screen, so I gave up and went to a bookshop. I as susceptible to the sunk cost fallacy as the next guy, so I couldn bring myself to buy the same book in paperback form. Instead I bought How to Make Money in Stocks by Bill O I halfway through and it quite interesting. It very focused toward longer-term trading of real companies, and taking into account the underlying performance of a company, but it still feels like it worth reading. I had a nagging voice in the back of my head all week:  be serious now, can you really know a stock is about to go up before it goes up? Aren all these charts just cherry-picked to match the  that you telling me is real? Well, How to Make Money in Stocks is doing a pretty good job of convincing me that this thing called technical analysis is indeed possible, because the book is quite honest about how difficult it is, and how infrequently a solid, reliable pattern shows itself, and how it will only be reliable under certain market conditions. The 100 cherry-picked, annotated chart examples span from 1880 to 2008, which says something about how few and far between solid predictive patterns are (according to this one dude). Billy boy also does a good job of explaining the reasoning behind this. About how  are scenarios that cause inexperienced traders to sell, and reducing volume indicates the general public losing interest in a stock and it dropping out of the news, and a huge volume increase can indicate that  institutions have shown up to buy in bulk the traders in the institutions all read the same books and look for the same patterns. All the while, the book is making the point that  not that simple and that it a lot of work. The other book I bought was a little more flashy, but got the thumbs up from a Nobel prize winner: Cryptoassets, by Jack Tatar (another tasty name!) and Chris Burniske. I start reading this next. I also watched a few of the more serious YouTube videos by people that have traded professionally and have a healthy dose of realism in their message. This was worth the 90 minutes: And this was worth the 50: Weekly summary I probably spent about 12 hours so far reading and watching videos (and five writing this post). I feel like I could do double that again knowledge and hearing different views jumping into actual charts and trading platforms. I feel like I should continue to hone my bullshit-detecting skills and therefore get more bang for my buck out of learning time. Maybe I share my favourite bits of hilariously terrible advice each week. I have one for this week: a gem from a YouTube video about drawing trend lines: No right or wrong? Resonates personally!? What fresh nonsense is this? Even with only one week experience, I almost certain that there is a wrong way to draw trend lines (in a loop-de-loop, with a crayon, for instance). And I hoping there a right way, too. Next week It will probably take me to the end of next week to finish off those two books. So be prepared for a thrilling ride next week. I also revise everything I said so far; I will have no allegiance to my beliefs of prior weeks, and the adjust numbers as I go. Parting thoughts There another way in which this trial may fail. I might hate it. I like being a web developer, I have fun writing code, solving problems, putting pixels in your eyeholes. Maybe staring at charts for hours on end will bore me to tears. But I hope that I will eventually become at one with the chart; I will see its personality, like a pet snake. I will know the way it behaves at different times of the day, sense when it hungry, when it needs to go potty, when to stay clear, when to give it a little snek pat. I really was torn about writing this blog post. Does anyone care? Does anyone want to read a weekly, detailed description of someone that knows nothing approaching trading in a not-at-all exciting way? If you did like this, SMASH THAT LIKE BUTTON. Otherwise, since Medium doesn have a down-vote button, you can let your silence do the talking. Thanks for reading, stay tuned for an update next week. Unless this only gets a lousy thousand claps in which case I take the hint and keep my digital mouth shut. Adios! And here week 2.',\n",
       "  '  more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you go.  Dr. Seuss A fact that most business leaders don know is that developing a cryptocurrency in Ethereum is surprisingly simple. Developers discover that as soon as they dive into coding smart contracts. For those without the confidence to code, cryptocurrencies remain arcane and complicated. Part of\\xa0my job\\xa0as Chief Architect for TechHQ is to teach CEOs about blockchain technology in terms that they understand so that we can design the technology under their business processes. I often see them assuming that cryptocurrencies are too complicated for them to understand. In this article, I going to explain what cryptocurrencies and tokens are with a business audience in mind. I going to show you the code as well, as most non-developers feel less intimidated once they see that the code for a cryptocurrency fits in a page.  A fact that most business leaders don know is that developing a cryptocurrency in Ethereum is surprisingly simple. Please note that this article refers to cryptocurrencies and tokens in Ethereum and to an extent other distributed computers such as Hyperledger. A cryptocurrency that runs on its own dedicated blockchain, such as Bitcoin, is much more complex to develop. Are you ready? Hold my hand and come into the rabbit hole Everyone hears first about the ERC20 term when researching cryptocurrencies. ERC is a label in the\\xa0Ethereum GitHub repository\\xa0that means that someone wants formal feedback on something. In the early days of Ethereum someone wanted feedback for a cryptocurrency specification and got the\\xa0ERC20\\xa0label. That is how history is often made, without much thought. Please have a look at the\\xa0ERC20 implementation from OpenZeppelin. That contract is the base for most of the cryptocurrencies out there. Don worry if you don understand too much of the code. Pay attention to the fact that it only has 228 lines of code, and of those two thirds are comments. It can be that complicated. You could deploy theERC20\\xa0contract as-is and you would have a cryptocurrency. Most likely you want to add some functionality such as a\\xa0token symbol and decimals, or\\xa0transfer restrictions, or to\\xa0stop transfers to invalid accounts. All these variations are only specifications to add more methods to an\\xa0ERC20\\xa0contract. They are not that different between them. You could deploy theERC20 contract as-is and you would have a cryptocurrency. If you need to add functionality to a cryptocurrency you don need to trawl the internet for some ERC token that does what you want. Cryptocurrencies are software applications, and very simple ones at that. If you need to track who are the holders of your token, for example, you can just\\xa0add a data structure\\xa0to your cryptocurrency that stores that information and update it when needed. You can make stuff up. Go wild. To recap, a cryptocurrency in Ethereum is: In the next section, we are going to go into the code to break it down even further. We are going to get rid of even more complexity to get to the very simple core of what a token is. The\\xa0ERC20 implementation from OpenZeppelin\\xa0has three contract variables and 13 methods. Contract variables are the data that is stored in the contract. The methods are what the contract can do with contract variables and data that is passed from outside. Consider the contract as an application that runs in the cloud, where you can activate its methods but nothing else. The contract sits there waiting for someone to ask for something and then returns a value or updates its contract variables. To code a very simple cryptocurrency I going to take some stuff from\\xa0ERC20\\xa0and I going to discard the rest. I going to keep in my contract a ledger for balances. In my cryptocurrency, each address relates to a certain value. In other words, each account holds some tokens. I am only going to implement four methods to check balances, create tokens, destroy tokens and transfer tokens. With that functionality I have a cryptocurrency that I can use for payments. The whole contract is below: A cryptocurrency in Ethereum can be as simple as a data structure with the balance of each account and a few functions to manage those balances. Now that you know what a cryptocurrency is, you can start adding more functionality according to your business models. At least you should implement the\\xa0ERC20\\xa0standard and use\\xa0SafeMath, the contract above is for educational purposes. I like to use\\xa0cryptocurrency\\xa0and\\xa0token\\xa0as two different terms. I like to say that a token is something that you can have, and a cryptocurrency something that you can have and can use to pay for things. One example of a token that is not a cryptocurrency is the contracts implemented with the\\xa0ERC721\\xa0standard. This is the one that you hear about when people talk about tokenization. The purpose of the\\xa0ERC721\\xa0standard is for each one of its tokens to represent a physical asset in the blockchain. In technical terms, it replaces the ledger of balances from ERC20 with a table that records who is the holder of each individual token: With this token, instead of saying that Bob has 100 tokens, I would say that Bob has tokens #100, #42 and #1337, for example. The four methods described for ERC20 change a bit, but in essence that is the difference between an ERC20 cryptocurrency contract and an\\xa0ERC721\\xa0token contract. By now you have seen that cryptocurrencies and tokens are a table with a few methods to manipulate the data. The description for a token is very flexible and there are many things that you can describe as tokens. When I design a solution I might fall into the habit of creating a lot of different tokens. It is easy to do since they are just tables linking users to something they have. I will use ERC standards when they are a good fit, but often I will code my token contracts from scratch. The description for a token is very flexible and there are many things that you can describe as tokens. A token for payments, another for voting rights, another for assets of some kind and so on. The marketing team always protests  a solution with four tokens is too complex to sell!. They are right. I am making their lives difficult. The fix is really simple. If a software design has too many tokens, I remove the word\\xa0token\\xa0from the description. I will have voting rights, asset keys, user handles, or whatever name I can come up with that doesn use the word token and doesn attract attention. Everyone is happy. A token is just a table and a few methods. The technology that makes cryptocurrencies possible is complex. The code that creates a cryptocurrency with those tools is not. Business leaders in the blockchain space would do well in trying to understand the basics of cryptocurrencies and tokens. Breaking through the apparent complexity will help them to\\xa0get their business ideas through to the development team. In this article I broken down the concept of cryptocurrencies and tokens to their bare minimum, to even less than the well-known ERC20 standard behind most blockchain applications. From that minimal starting point, I shown cryptocurrencies and tokens to be very simple at the core, before business functionality is added. Do you have an idea for a blockchain solution? Do you know your business but struggle to find a technologist that speaks your language. Please feel free to contact me, I love bringing business and technology together.      ',\n",
       "  'Nearly all markets at some point go through a bubble. But not all bubbles are the same, and some of them tend to get more attention due to various events, hype or the level of a potential impact on the global economy. Just for a perspective, at some point of their development, the following stocks had a significant drop in value: GOPRO (GoPro): -95%, FIT (FitBit): -92%; LC (LendingClub): -91%; SNAP (most known as a creator of Snapchat): -83%; ZNGA (Zynga): -77%; TWTR (Twitter): -63%; SPOT (Spotify): -48%; DOCU (Docusign): -45%; FB (Facebook): -42%. Perhaps the most conspicuous analogy of an infamous crypto crash is the dot-com bubble. Crypto market cap fell by 80% to its high, while Nasdaq Composite Index fell by 78% during the dot-com crash. Other similarities include explosive growth and grandiose expectations of the capabilities of underlying technologies. Does this mean that crypto market is following the pattern of the dot-com bubble? Indeed, the dot-com bubble and the hypothetical crypto bubble share many striking similarities. In the early 1990s, the internet was fast emerging and by mid-1990s a rapid increase in the households computer ownership rose from 15% to 35%. The sense of the  big thing incentivized the launch of internet-based companies met with significant injections of investments thanks to the low interest rates. In the early 2010s, bitcoin and its underlying technology blockchain were fast emerging. A few years later, increasing publicity, a rush to make a quick fortune, and the idea of a decentralized and free-of-the-government-involvement financial system incentivized the launch of many blockchain-based companies, met with significant injections of investments thanks to the economic stability in some countries and the lack of thereof in others. Adding .com to a company name significantly increased the companies valuations. Most of these companies didn have profits, but pure speculation and a lack of a robust fundamental basis led to their significant overvaluation and the interest of the investors sensing the  big thing Adding  or  words to a company name significantly\\xa0increased\\xa0the companies valuations. Most of these companies didn have a product, robust business model or profits. However, pure speculation and a lack of a robust fundamental basis led to their significant overvaluation and the interest of the investors sensing the  big thing As the bubble grew, Investment banks got involved, profiting greatly from initial public offerings (IPO) and subsequently, touting further investment. As the bubble grew, the coin issuance companies got involved, profiting greatly from initial coin offerings (ICO) that resulted in 8.7bn in total funding. Many people had started trading full time and investors were turning into millionaires overnight. Between 1995 and 2000, the Nasdaq composite stock market index rose 400%\\xa0to an all-time reaching the value of over\\xa0$6 trillion\\xa0in March of 2000. Between 2016 and 2017, the price of bitcoin and many other coins kept rising, and by the end of 2017 the Bitcoin price rose to $19k. Many investors started trading full time and turning into millionaires overnight. Expectations were set high, the market was too excited, while many of the dot-coms were unable to come up with sustainable business models to help them prove at least some correlation between companies valuations and the invested funds. The dot-com bubble burst happened in March 2000, shortly after the Nasdaq index posted its high of 5048 points. This was followed by sell-offs of the stocks by large tech firms such as Intel, Dell, and Cisco causing a public panic. Expectations were set high, the market was too excited, while many of the blockchain companies were unable to develop sustainable business models which would help prove at least some correlation between companies valuations and the invested funds. The crypto bubble burst in December 2017, shortly after the Bitcoin price surpassed $19k. This was the breaking point for selling off the bitcoin and other crypto holdings by many investors, causing even more panic. Within the 2-year period after the burst, the Nasdaq composite dropped from 5048.62 points to 1114.11 points, equal to 77% and a disappeared $5 trillion worth of investments. Hundreds of companies liquidated what little capital they had left, and closed by 2004. 48% of companies managed to continue their operations. Some of those that managed to stay afloat eventually surpassed their original market caps. Among those are Amazon and Google. Hundreds of companies liquidated what little capital they had left, and closed by 2019. Only some of the companies managed to continue their operations. Some of them were met with regulatory accusations. Companies that managed to stay afloat could potentially surpass their original market caps. New players are entering the industry. In December 1999, Amazon stock price hit its first and the only one for the upcoming decade, peak of $107, followed by a massive drop of ~90% to ~$6 in about a year. It took almost a decade to reach its previous highs. Today, AMZN price is at $1,950, which is 32000% growth from its lows $6. Crypto Following the crash and till now, the hype has fallen down and speculation got to the normal levels. Meanwhile, the companies are developing the technology and launching new products while regulators are working out the regulatory mechanisms of the industry. All these advancements lead to a slow but sure adoption. A crypto market leader Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at just over $5,000, down -75% from its all-time high of around $19,665 in December 2017. Regardless of how realistic this price point is, this dot-com comparison offers a point of view that we should consider. However, it is important to note that blindly comparing the price of one of the dot-com market leaders to Bitcoin would be immature. While this comparison offers an interesting and a potentially possible point of view on the future of Bitcoin and the blockchain industry, an output of any endeavor, be it new technology, a new type of currency or a completely new industry, and its value have to eventually align. Among success factors are efficiency/ technological robustness, market adoption, network effects, the scale of its impact on economies and industries, team, and a community. The scope of a provided value will determine Amazons and Googles of the blockchain industry. In the meantime, while Bitcoin is going through continuous improvements, we may very well see new market players entering the gameboard with the only desire to get the crown.   ',\n",
       "  'Blockchain\\xa0is evolving into a new phase of our technological society. It is growing exponentially like other life-changing technologies used to, similar to the internet. The different possible ways of making money, presenting projects and bringing new ideas to light every day is what makes the\\xa0cryptocurrency\\xa0world so interesting. But let focus on a soon very hot topic, security tokens. Utility tokens were one of the hottest topics in the past bull run, ICOs and token generation events were the easiest and quickest way for a project to raise funds. Same for the investors, the returns in ICOs used to be way higher than by investing in higher market cap coins. For the next era of blockchain technology, we should prepare for something new,\\xa0security tokens. Imagine a fully-regulated token that represents shares of a company. A\\xa0utility token\\xa0is the  backed by a project, which is used to raise money in an\\xa0ICO\\xa0and should at least have some use. Usually, these are Ethereum based tokens, since this is one of the most simple ways of creating a token and programming some smart contracts on it. The actual  of these tokens is mostly some sort of access to a platform, or a currency to purchase a specific service. On the other hand,\\xa0security tokens\\xa0or\\xa0equity tokens\\xa0are a regulated way of creating a token and building its own ICO. Unlike utility tokens, security tokens don need to have a  Their use case is that they represent a real share of the company. So this type of token is the equivalent of issuing company stock on the blockchain. Regarding the founders of a Security token based company, it won be that easy to raise millions anymore. The team won just create a website and a whitepaper to start raising money.\\xa0This time the tokens and the company are regulated by the Government, which reduces the chances of a fraud.\\xa0Or at least enough to get accepted by the institutional regulations. So when we talk about security tokens, that where the traditional stocks and the blockchain framework find their way of getting together. Security tokens are a brand new\\xa0cryptocurrency category\\xa0that will likely play a major role in the space in the next years. The main idea of a security token is to remove the middleman in a transaction. This middleman is the main cause of risk, fees and delays in non-peer-to-peer transactions. In Anthony Pompliano\\xa0words Security tokens also come with many benefits for regulators. Issuers can, for example, code lock-up periods right into the security token. This makes the violation of lock-up period times physically impossible. In the year of 2018 we will see how STOs (Security Token Offerings) and ETOs (Equity Token Offerings) dominate the blockchain market. And since this new way of contributing to a project or asset is SEC regulated, there will be fewer worries for new people entering the market. People who used to dislike cryptocurrencies might now feel safer venturing into the space and start experimenting with the technology. This next  of new money flowing into Security Tokens, might be a little different than it happened with ICOs. There will be fewer STOs as there were ICOs, since the process of building one is way more complex. But still, there will be quite a lot of them. So more certainly, in this phase of the cryptocurrency space, there will be a couple of STOs dominating the market. Tweet me at\\xa0@alexthellmann',\n",
       "  \"Today, I am excited to launch the first new artwork for the website of ethereum.org. Every few months, the website will be updated with new artwork that reflects a new aspect of Ethereum's identity. The concept of the work focuses on one of Ethereum major strengths: the community. Our artwork:  of alien looks or words must stick together is a collaborative work that captures the idea of common identity among participants in the Ethereum ecosystem.  The work consists of two major elements: Dialect and The New Octahedron. Dialect is a statement of inclusion and diversity in the Ethereum community. The familiarity of native speech assists the individuals in the understanding of notions as well as offers a sense of affinity and inclusion. When the word  is used in a local context, it is translated into the language of that community. The first time I saw the word written in my mother tongue, Thai, it instantly gave me a sense of familiarity and inclusiveness in the very same way as when I overheard people having a conversation in Thai in an unexpected place. By internalising this experience, I was able to grasp that this open-source community is becoming a global village. In this first version of Dialect, I have gathered the spelling of  in 12 languages, which are English, Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, Korean, Greek, Serbian, Arabic, Thai, Russian, Hindi and Hebrew.  The New Octahedron The New Octahedron is an emblem of collaboration and personalisation. Ethereum visual identity is a three-dimensional octahedron platonic solid. The (reddit) folklore holds that Texture and Vitalik designed this symbol based on two  symbols ( rotated 45 degrees to each side. The winner of the bounty reworked this when, after the pre-sale was launched, it took on a diamond-like shape. Today, Ethereum has become the world largest open-source blockchain community. Its core technology is used as novel solutions to real-world problems and serve a myriad of needs. We have come a long way from the initial two summation symbols.  If you have been part of the ecosystem for a while like I have, you will likely get to interact with Ethereum either via writing your own smart contract, contributing to the improvement and maintenance of the base protocol, designing an interface for decentralised applications, mining and trading cryptocurrency, building a community, etc. It is safe to say that no experiences are the same, so perception toward the brand image is individual.  What better way to visualise Ethereum than to embrace the creativity of our talented community? Therefore I turned to my friends who are an artist and a pioneer in the Non-Fungible Token (NFT) arts: Ilan Katin, Mattia Cuttini, Oficinas TK, XCOPY. Each of us creates our own version of Ethereum brand image. All the artwork is then layered and stitched together to form a loop animation of a consistent flow of identity.  The artwork is visualised in this respective order. Mattia Cuttini -  used the  of my 16 segments series to assemble a colourful version of the Ethereum logotype. In a sort of way, I think it is a meeting between classic and futuristic things Oficinas TK -  really like to work with halftones, and that what I went for on this one; there really no concept, but rather a graphic glitchy exploration of the identity XCOPY -  feel like Ethereum is brought to life by a community of creatives. I wanted to place the logo into an environment where it was surrounded and supported by a vortex of colour Lili Feyerabend -  work consists of a two-series animation titled  cats and a unicorn While social coding and bug-fixing are the major parts of our culture, the unicorn is a sign of hope that what we working on will change the world for the better. The image of a cat symbolises the fun and playfulness of today Internet The collages are made from the combination of my own photography work and those that I found on the Internet. Note that the first and second parts are displayed separately (the latter appears after Ilan work). Ilan Katin -  for me is a form of meditation. This particular approach to drawing, along with the processes I use to create an animation from it, is priceless to me. By having my lines flow through the logo in order to give it form, I am expressing how Ethereum facilitates the flow of value created by people  I would like to note that this work is a continuum of effort and was only possible with the support of the Ethereum Foundation's website team. Josh Stark reached out to me and introduced me to Alan Woo, who has laid out the structure of the new website and integrated our artwork. The talented Ilan Katin assembled the series of artworks; he is not only an NFT artist but also a DJ at Bergain on a good day. Dialect will always be a work in progress as our community grows, and it can only be improved with your help. My twitter's DM is always open  feel free to ping if you wish to add your language to the list.   I joined Ethereum in early 2018 after years of working in design, the humanitarian law field (legal aid, online privacy & cybersec law). The idea of a decentralised Internet fascinates me and led me to start experimenting with the ever-widening possibilities for this concept. I became more involved with the community by helping to organise hackathon events, DevCon UX track and by working for several start-ups as a product designer. I am particularly interested in a cooperative business models, progressive digital privacy rights, cats and karaoke.  Visit my page impermanence.co or say hello on twitter. \",\n",
       "  'India long-standing aversion to cryptocurrencies has never been a secret.\\xa0 In fact, its apex banking body, the Reserve Bank of India, has often found itself making headlines for its slew of attempts to discourage crypto use within the country financial ecosystem.\\xa0 Yet, despite the challenges posed to it by the lack of regulatory support, the crypto community in India had soldiered on, hoping to usher in a  India that would have space for crypto assets. A new draft bill, titled Banning of Cryptocurrency & Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill 2019, prepared by an inter-ministerial committee, has somewhat thrown off the optimism of several crypto investors and many tech-focused startups in the country, by calling for criminalisation and jail term for trading in crypto. Coming shortly after the right-wing Modi government took office with a resounding mandate from the people, the new draft, reflects the authorities growing concern with the widespread incidence of crypto scams and tries to rein in the possibility of risks to investors.\\xa0 The underlying intentions of the bill seem justified, especially considering how the $300 million crypto scam case involving the Bharadwaj brothers have jolted the Indian crypto enthusiasts out of their complacency of late.\\xa0 Yet, the harsh prosecution model that has been suggested by the draft bill, with jail term of upto 10 years, being proposed for the act of crypto trading, has garnered criticism for being unwarranted. In addition, several frequent investors, and many insiders in India burgeoning startup ecosystem have pointed out some inherent issues with the draft bill. To analyse and understand the bill prepared by the inter-ministerial committee, it is essential to understand its basic premise and arguments. With the committee being headed by Subhash Chandra Garg, secretary, Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), the proposed draft bill seeks to put in place a complete ban on the use of cryptocurrencies in the country, either as currency or as legal tender. Instead, it focuses on the need to encourage and facilitate the growth of the blockchain industry, harping upon the multitude of use cases digital ledger technologies can potentially support. Even though it summarily dismisses the need to leave some room for blockchain primary form of application: the cryptocurrency, it seems open to having a Digital Rupee or a CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency).\\xa0 While it is indeed interesting and even heartening to note that the committee is considering a modified application of the original crypto model, many players in the Indian venture capital and startup sectors have raised questions about the sagacity about such a suggestion. Nischal Shetty, one of the co-founders of the startup WazirX, a Mumbai-based crypto exchanging service, has pointed out a fundamental irony in the committee argument.\\xa0 Various contradictions stated in the report, are as follows: If the draft bill is passed and made into law, it would present a significant hindrance to the fast-growing startups based in the crypto payments ecosystem, and would also disadvantage venture capitalists and angel investors who have bet their money on crypto. It would also discourage foreign investments from flowing into the sector, thereby effectively shutting off a prospective route of economic growth. Many commentators have argued that the draft bill seems to be in contravention of Article 19 (1) (g) of the Indian Constitution, which gives traders the fundamental rights to freedom of trading in their preferred industry. However, as I see it, the legislators of the country do have the power to override that contravention by deeming the industry itself illegal. After all, no drug peddler could convincingly claim of being stripped of his fundamental right to trade under Article 19(1)(g)! Having said that, even if the legislators were to indeed exercise such a power, it would be quite difficult to actually implement a complete ban. After all, the basic notion of crypto allows for a great deal of privacy, which means that if one wanted to be evade traceability while trading in crypto, it would not be too difficult to ensure. A blanket ban is likely to promote a Streisand Effect, which results in people desiring a prohibited thing more with greater enthusiasm than they would have otherwise had. In any case, India has already seen crypto users shelling out a premium upward of $500 to get their hands on crypto in the face of the government hardening stance. A complete prohibition is hardly likely to take that interest away. If anything, it will only increase the risk of scams by leading to the creation of an unregulated underground market. One promising aspect that does emerge from the report is its suggestion to constitute a Standing Committee that would periodically revisit the observations of the Garg report. This indicates that the inter-ministerial committee is not shutting the door on future prospects and developments entirely. In any case, introducing appropriate regulations instead of straightway banning the use of cryptocurrencies would be far more beneficial to those at a risk of being scammed in crypto-related cases as that would allow them a legally defined avenue to seek redressal. Otherwise, they would simply have to deal with the repercussions of operating in an unregulated, criminalised industry by themselves, without the perpetrators of the scam being brought to task. Since the report does not suggest how existing investors and players in the crypto industry can withdraw without attracting legal penalties, it is unclear as to how the effects of such a bill will pan out in the short run. In the long run, the inadequate implementability of the suggestions also make the draft bill sounds like it could do with some revisions. As of now, the government has not confirmed its intention to ban crypto. In fact, when Anurag Thakur, the Minister of State for Finance and Corporate Affairs, was asked in the Rajya Sabha if his government had essentially prohibited crypto in India, he said that it was not the case. He said: As it stands now, we must let time run its course and let us know if the proposed ban will really be implemented. For now, the crypto insiders and startup founders are keeping their fingers crossed!',\n",

Every user has one or more accounts on the EOS blockchain. EOS accounts are human-readable identifiers that are stored on the blockchain and they are required to push or transfer any (valid) transaction to the EOS blockchain. These accounts can also be owned by multiple people depending on the permissions configuration. EOS accounts are 12 characters long and can contain the letters a-z and the digits 1 These account names replace the long and clumsy wallet addresses that are used in most cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, every EOS account has permissions. Permissions can be seen as requirements which need to be fulfilled in order for a transaction to go through. An EOS account has 2 native permissions by default: Besides these 2 native permissions you can create new, custom, permissions that fit your needs. Each permission has one or multiple keys and/or account name(s) associated with it. Each key or account name associated with a permission has a certain\\xa0weight, and each permission has a certain weight\\xa0threshold which needs to be met before a transaction requiring that permission is accepted. Visualization of a default permissions structure. (Source:\\xa0EOSIO Developer Portal) To help you understand all of this information we have included the above image, which visualizes the permissions structure of a default EOS account. As you can see, the\\xa0owner\\xa0permission has a default\\xa0threshold\\xa0of 1, and 1 key with a\\xa0weight\\xa0of 1 associated with it. The same goes for the\\xa0active permission which has a default\\xa0threshold\\xa0of 1, and 1 key with a\\xa0weight\\xa0of 1 associated with it.\\xa0 This means that only the (private) key associated with the\\xa0owner\\xa0or\\xa0active permission is required to perform any transaction requiring the\\xa0owner\\xa0or\\xa0active\\xa0permission. Now you are familiar with the structure of an EOS account, it time to learn about account resources. Each EOS account has 3 resources:\\xa0 CPU,\\xa0network and\\xa0RAM, which all allow users to do different things. We will explain each resource individually below using a\\xa0metaphor by EOS Asia. How resources in an EOS account (can) look If the EOS blockchain was a train, CPU, network and RAM could be explained in the following way: Network would be the available seats in each train leaving and entering the blockchain. Your chair will always be reserved, and if u need it, it will be yours. BUT, if no one is on the train, you could lay across a bunch of chairs because they are free! So network is a way to make sure you have somewhere to sit when the train leaves. CPU is how often you can ride the train, and works much like network as far as allocation goes. You may have a train ticket, but of course the ticket is only usable on certain days and times. Now the EOS train is pretty laid back, so any unused space is free to use re: CPU and network, are free to use the people that paid for the space need to use the space.  CPU and network are joint resources that together are called BANDWITH.  RAM is your storage space on the train. If you need to bring a ton of luggage, you need to pay per bag to check your bags onto the train. If you do not need to bring a lot of luggage, you can sell your storage space to others that are riding on the train. CPU\\xa0and\\xa0network\\xa0can be obtained by staking EOS, which is essentially locking your tokens for a certain time. When the user wants to move their EOS they can unstake their tokens, essentially making transactions free.\\xa0RAM\\xa0can not be obtained through staking but can instead be bought and sold and is used to hold other tokens for example. You now understand both the structure and the resources of EOS accounts, so it time to put all of this together in order to fully understand EOS accounts. EOS accounts and permissions visualized. (Source:\\xa0Blockgenic) In the above image you can see how the account structure is related to the account resources. The light blue lines indicate\\xa0CPU\\xa0&\\xa0NET\\xa0are needed to perform any action requiring that permission. The red line indicates\\xa0RAM\\xa0is needed to hold other tokens. This should give you a solid understanding of how an EOS account operates. Using the permissions structure within EOS you can do many interesting things. One of those things is creating a multisignature account, which is relatively easy on the EOS network. In general, a multisignature account (more commonly known on other blockchains as a multisignature wallet) is an account that requires more than 1 signature in order to perform a transaction. EOS accounts are more complicated, as they have multiple permissions with multiple actions associated with that permission, instead of a single possible action which is the case on most current blockchains. As a result of this more complicated account system it is possible to change the earlier described\\xa0threshold\\xa0of a permission that needs to be met before any transaction requiring that permission can be executed. It is also possible to then add multiple keys with different\\xa0weights\\xa0to the permission. Using these principles you can then require multiple keys to sign a transaction before it (and the action that the transaction performs) executes, essentially making your permission a multisignature permission!

       "  \"An interesting fact about Libra Facebook native currency [1] which was announced June 18th, it inspired from three distinct elements: the Roman weight measurement system, the astrological sign for justice, and the French term  for freedom.  The culmination of these three elements embodies the essence of Libra, which aims to be a global cryptocurrency for everyone. The focus of Libra is to create a currency that empowers billions of people, allowing them to engage in friction-less financial transactions in a simple, secure, and cost-effective manner. [2] But Facebook is launching two cryptocurrencies not just Libra. As part of June 18th big reveal of the social network ambitious plan to\\xa0create a global fiat-backed blockchain currency, (Fiat currency is government-issued currency like the dollar). Facebook said that in addition to Libra, the project will also issue a  investment token. Unlike Libra  a currency that will be broadly available to the public  the investment token is a security, according to Facebook. As such, the token will be sold to a much more exclusive audience: the founding corporate members of the project governing consortium, known as the Libra Association, and accredited investors. And while Libra will be backed by a basket of fiat currencies and government securities, interest earned on that collateral will go to holders of the investment tokens. Each of the 28 companies that Facebook recruited to run validating nodes as founding members of the consortium invested at least $10 million for the privilege. The investment token is what they received as a financial reward. \\xa0 the assets in the reserve are low risk and low yield, returns for early investors will only materialize if the network is successful and the reserve grows substantially in size, Facebook said in one of a series of documents that supplement the long-awaited Libra white paper. Further, the tokens will give holders proportional clout in the early governance of Libra. An investor who buys the tokens doesn have to run a node, but unless they do, they don get to vote as members. [12] But every new trend, idea or concept in order to become mainstream must clear three obstacles namely : Technology , Business and Society (Government and Customers) The same applies to Libra , where, essentially, Facebook wants to make it as easy to move money around the world as it is to send a text message with lower fees, more accessibility and close-to-instantaneous transfers worldwide.\\xa0[2] The company released a White Paper to explain the details. It doesn see the cryptocurrency as an attempt to replace the current financial system, as is Bitcoin aim. Rather, it intended to extend a digital payment method to under-served populations that don currently have easy access to traditional financial institutions. Worldwide, almost two billion adults  outside of the financial system with no access to a traditional bank, even though one billion have a mobile phone and nearly half a billion have internet access, reads the paper. Libra aims to fill the gap. How will Libra work? Libra will be managed by a Swiss-based nonprofit. It is currently backed by Facebook and more than two dozen Founding Member companies, including Ebay, Uber, Lyft, Spotify, Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Coinbase and venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, Libra will be backed by  government-backed assets from central banks to give it stability. Facebook says Libra will be made available to Messenger and WhatsApp users, who can cash in their local currency to buy Libra. The currency will be held in a digital wallet called Calibra and can be spent on products and services at participating merchants, just like any other currency. To withdraw funds, users will be able to convert their digital currency into legal tender based on an exchange rate. It won be so dissimilar to when you exchange U.S. dollars for euros during a European vacation, for example. For those worried about security, Libra payments will not be connected to a user Facebook data\\xa0and won be used for ad targeting. Libra will not be available until the first half of 2020, so you can buy the currency today. Once it does become available, there should be several ways consumers can buy the currency, and you won necessarily need to go through Facebook. Transaction fees will likely be lower than those currently charged by traditional finance companies, which will primarily benefit merchants, but also people who, for example, routinely send money to family members abroad and are forced to rely on expensive wire transfer services. How is this different from a credit card? One of the purposes of Libra is to serve people who do not currently have access to traditional banking and financial tools. Currently cryptocurrencies can be used like a credit card to buy goods online. But Libra will theoretically go beyond that. Consumers will be able to purchase the currency and use it at participating merchants.  have a balance of, say, $100, you go to a merchant, you scan your smartphone for a $10 purchase, the Libras are taken out of your account and held by the merchant, Transaction fees will also be lower than they are for traditional forms of payment. Calibra is similar, then, to a payment network like PayPal, but uses the cryptocurrency Libra rather than a fiat currency, like the U.S. dollar for transactions.[1] Libra will be a stable digital currency, which will be fully backed by real assets stored in the Libra reserve. Stablecoins are cryptocurrency that are stable in value, usually pegged from a real-world currency (such as US$) or a commodity (such as gold) that are stable in nature. The Libra reserve is created through funds originating from both investors in the separate Investment Token, and users of Libra. This means that you can invest in the project through an Investment Token that could potentially pay out dividends in the future or if you are keen on getting your hands-on Libra coin itself, you have to convert your local currency into Libra. Essentially, Libra is only created when there is more fiat with which it is either exchanged or backed up. The Libra reserve will then be invested in low-risk assets that will yield interest over time, which will then be used to cover operational costs, support low transaction fees, and pay dividends to Investment Token investors who helped jump-start the ecosystem. The stability of Libra will therefore be supported by a global basket of fiat currencies and low-risk assets; likewise, you can convert your Libra at any time according to the prevailing exchange rate to your local currency. Facebook will relinquish control over Libra, instead conferring control to Libra Association, a Geneva-based non-profit organization with a long list of prominent founding members, including Paypal, Mastercard, Stripe, Visa, eBay, Lyft, Spotify, Uber, and Coinbase. Currently, there are 28 members, each of whom are required to invest $10 million into the development of Libra.The Libra foundation aims to accumulate a total of 100 partners with a reserve fund of $1 billion, which is going to be used to manage Libra price stability. All members will also be granted a single vote for the governance of Libra, with each entity serving as nodes in the Libra network. The association will also spearhead Libra native open-source technology, by promoting its developer platform, which is fueled by its own programming language. Given the wide reach of the cumulative networks of all members in the association, it is not hard to imagine that there will be a colossal base of ready users for Libra, something which would have been incomprehensible with any other past cryptocurrency projects, particularly on this scale. Libra will be built on the Libra blockchain, a natively developed open-sourced blockchain that uses a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus approach called LibraBFT Consensus Protocol (voting based protocol used in hyperledger networks). However, the Libra blockchain will initially be a permissioned (closed) blockchain. This means that access to the network is limited to a handful of selected and pre-approved entities who will become nodes in the system. Libra will gradually transit into a permissionless network (similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum networks) within five years of the public launch of Libra blockchain and ecosystem. The rationale behind this is that a permissionless network has limitations in terms of speed and scalability, and in order to deliver a scalable, secure, and stable solution globally across billions of people and transactions, it needs to be a permissioned system at first. That said, Libra blockchain will be open in the sense that anyone can use the network and even build applications on top of the blockchain. [8] The Libra Blockchain  With 5KB transactions, 1000 verifications per second verifications on commodity CPUs, and up to 4 billion accounts, the Libra Blockchain should be able to operate at 1000 tps (transactions per second) if nodes used at least 40Mbps connections and 16TB SSD hard drives. Transactions on Libra cannot be reversed. If an attack compromises over one-third of the validator nodes causing a fork in the Blockchain, the Libra Association says it will temporarily halt transactions, figure out the extent of the damage, and recommend software updates to resolve the fork. [8] Libra blockchain will facilitate smart contract  functionality, using a relatively new language called  Smart contracts are pre-programmed contracts that are self-executabe, thereby  allowing for the automation of contracts without the need of any third parties or intermediaries. Move is a simple but powerful language, and is relatively suitable as a  programming language More importantly, Move is designed with a key focus on security and safety, since leveraging a simpler language facilitates easier code writing and execution, and reduces the risk of unintended bugs or security flaws. The  first application to be built to support a cryptocurrency must be a wallet. This is exactly the case with Libra, in which Calibra, a cryptocurrency wallet, will facilitate the storage and exchange of Libra coins. Calibra will be the first application to be built on the Libra blockchain. Calibra is also the name of the company which will develop the wallet, and is in fact a subsidiary of Facebook, built to ensure separation between financial and social data, and to build and operate services on its behalf on top of the Libra blockchain. Calibra will be available as a mobile application and will also be integrated with Facebook Messenger application and WhatsApp, allowing users to convert fiat currency into Libra in their wallets and thereafter send, receive, and pay for stuff using Libra. [8] According to Facebook, almost half of adults in the world don have an active bank account, with the figures worse in developing countries and even worse for women. Approximately 70% of small businesses in developing countries lack access to credit, and $25 billion is lost by migrants annually through remittance fees. [9] Facebook has more than 1.5 billion users on both WhatsApp and Messenger\\xa0yet\\xa0makes almost no money from the messaging services. When Facebook revealed its Libra\\xa0plans, the company also said it\\xa0would soon put new digital wallets inside these apps so users can easily use the cryptocurrency to send money to friends and businesses anywhere in the world. If the plan works, WhatsApp and Messenger will become new\\xa0payments and commerce hubs that take small-but-profitable cuts from billions of transactions.\\xa0 Facebook has a checkered record in payments. But China WeChat and QQ show\\xa0what possible when\\xa0messaging apps cleverly fold\\xa0payments and other services into the mix. WeChat and QQ make\\xa0money by facilitating payments between users and merchants, distributing mobile games, and selling\\xa0digital goods, such as stickers and avatars. The services have\\xa0turned owner Tencent Holdings Ltd. into\\xa0the most valuable publicly traded company in China.\\xa0 Facebook crypto push could facilitate similar offerings in\\xa0payments, shopping, apps and gaming, while tapping into the company huge user base in Asia, where it has nearly four\\xa0times as many monthly active users as it does in North America, according to RBC Capital Markets. For now, Facebook and its new subsidiary Calibra, which is building the digital wallets, are framing the new currency as a way for individuals to send money to each other across borders. David Marcus, who is leading Facebook Libra efforts, said\\xa0that the company doesn plan to take a fee when people send money to friends, and will likely charge  transaction fees for payments to businesses. If people do start stuffing their new digital wallets with Libra, it might not take years for Facebook to turn that activity\\xa0into revenue. Marcus believes the new wallets could have a more immediate financial impact on a business line Facebook knows well: Targeted advertising. If\\xa0users have Libra on hand as they\\xa0scroll\\xa0through Facebook News Feed, when they click on an ad it will be easier to buy something. That would make\\xa0Facebook ads more appealing to marketers.\\xa0  there is more commerce happening on the platform, then small businesses will end up spending more and advertising will be more effective for them, Marcus said. [7] To generate higher levels of adoption among users, Libra has developed an incentive program to encourage more developers to create applications on Libra blockchain, and more merchants to accept Libra as a payment currency. Node operators, who represent the founding members of the Libra association, will be rewarded with Libra coins for getting users to sign up and use Libra. Businesses that attract users towards Calibra will also be rewarded with incentives which they can pass on, in part or in their entirety, to users in the form of discounts or free Libra tokens for their purchases. Merchants in the network are also incentivized by receiving a percentage of the transaction value back for each transaction that is processed on the platform. The incentive programs are targeted towards the entire Libra network, ensuring that a holistic approach is undertaken to foster adoption in the usage of Libra.\\xa0 Government The company crypto plans are already under fire from regulators in Washington and Europe who don like the idea of Facebook dipping its toe in yet another aspect of people personal lives. And gaining consumer trust after years of privacy mishaps may\\xa0be harder than Facebook expects. A letter from US House Representatives Committee on Financial Services to Facebook sent on July 2, Facebook to officially put the project on hold. Today, cryptocurrencies are backed solely by the willingness of users to accept them, not because they have any intrinsic value or are backed by any government. This makes such currencies unstable. Libra, however, will be backed by reserves: If a user buys a dollar of Libra, that dollar will presumably be held in reserve somewhere, ready to be honored when someone sells that Libra. Moreover, while most cryptocurrencies are hard to use, Libra promises to be user-friendly and embedded into Facebook and WhatsApp. There are four core problems with Facebook new currency [3]. The first, and perhaps the simplest, is that organizing a payments system is a complicated and difficult task, one that requires enormous investment in compliance systems. Banks pay attention to details, complying with regulations to prevent money-laundering, terrorist financing, tax avoidance and counterfeiting. Recreating such a complex system is not a project that an institution with the level of privacy and technical problems like Facebook should be leading. [3] The second problem is that, since the Civil War, the United States has had a general prohibition on the intersection between banking and commerce. Such a barrier has been reinforced many times, such as in 1956 with the Bank Holding Company Act and in 1970 with an amendment to that law during the conglomerate craze. Both times, Congress blocked banks from going into nonbanking businesses through holding companies, because Americans historically didn want banks competing with their own customers. Banking and payments is a special business, where a bank gets access to intimate business secrets of its customers. [3] Imagine Facebook subsidiary Calibra knowing your account balance and your spending, and offering to sell a retailer an algorithm that will maximize the price for what you can afford to pay for a product. Imagine this cartel having this kind of financial visibility into not only many consumers, but into businesses across the economy. Such conflicts of interest are why payments and banking are separated from the rest of the economy in the United States. [3] It also possible that insiders belonging to the Libra cartel could exploit their access to information, business relationships or technology to give themselves advantages. There are many ways a new currency system could advantage large businesses over everyone else, especially when the large ones are sitting on the board of governors for the payments system. For instance, one of the incentives is to get people to use the currency is discounts on Uber rides; if this happens, Facebook would be giving an advantage to Uber instead of other ride-sharing businesses. [3] The third problem is that the Libra system introduces systemic risk into our economy. The Libra currency is backed, presumably, by bonds and financial assets held in reserve at the Libra Reserve. But what happens if there is a theft or penetration of the system? What happens if all users want to sell their Libra currency at once, causing the Libra Reserve to hold a fire sale of assets? If the Libra system becomes intertwined in our global economy in the way Facebook hopes, we would need to consider a public bailout of a privately managed system. We should not be setting up a private international payments network that would need to be backed by taxpayers because it too big to fail. [3] The fourth problem is that of national security and sovereignty. Enabling an open flow of money across all borders is a political choice best made by governments. And openness isn always good. For instance, most nations, especially the United States, use economic sanctions to bar individuals, countries or companies from using our financial system in ways that harm our interests. Sanctions enforcement flows through the banking system  if you can bank in dollars, you can use dollars. With the success of a private parallel currency, government sanctions could lose their bite.\\xa0A permissionless currency system based on a consensus of large private actors across open protocols sounds nice, but it not democracy. Today, American bank regulators and central bankers are hired and fired by publicly elected leaders. Libra payments regulators would be hired and fired by a self-selected council of corporations. There are ways to characterize such a system, but democratic is not one of them. [3] Facebook is trying to convince U.S. regulators that it is ready to\\xa0fight efforts by foreigners to interfere with the 2020 Presidential Election while at the same time promoting its Libra cryptocurrency that may make it easier to do just that. The social media giant says it will accept the cryptocurrency anywhere where it takes payments and at least for now won't rule out allowing it to be used to buy political ads Eight U.S. House candidates raised $550,000 in bitcoin contributions from 20 states between 2014 and 2018, according to the Center for Public Integrity. States have varying views on cryptocurrency political contributions. Some such as Colorado, Kansas, and the District of Columbia permit it while others such as California outlaw the practice out of concerns over potential foreign meddling. [10] The Libra Association, a not-for-profit organization based in Switzerland, will have several layers of governance, the most powerful of which is a council, on which each member organization will have a representative.  council delegates many of its executive powers to the association management but retains authority to override delegated decisions and keep key decisions to itself, with the most important ones requiring a greater than two-thirds supermajority, according to another supplementary document released by Facebook. As mentioned, to become a member, the initial investors must put in at least $10 million. In addition, a business must meet at least one of several elite criteria, such as being on a list like the Fortune 500. For every $10 million invested, a member gets one vote, subject to a cap of 1 percent of total votes, in order to prevent the concentration of power in any single entity. However, the financial reward remains proportional to the amount invested no matter how much. The council will be responsible for standard governance matters, such as appointing an executive team for the association, led by a managing director, and a board of directors to oversee them; setting the top executive compensation; and managing the currency underlying reserves. But the body will also have final say over technical questions, such as activating new features to the protocol and resolving situations  compromised validator nodes have resulted in many signed versions of the Libra Blockchain, according to the document. While Facebook newly created Calibra subsidiary will be a consortium member with a council seat, the social network stressed it won be in charge for long.  the Libra network launches, Facebook, and its affiliates, will have the same commitments, privileges, and financial obligations as any other Founding Member, the company said.  one member among many, Facebook role in governance of the association will be equal to that of its peers. The exact components of the basket of assets securing Libra are to be determined. But broadly, it will be  with capital preservation and liquidity in mind, according to the social media giant. Importantly, while the coin has been described in early press coverage as a stablecoin, Facebook noted that  the point of view of any specific currency, there will be fluctuations in the\\xa0value of Libra. \\xa0 makeup of the reserve is designed to mitigate the likelihood and severity of these\\xa0fluctuations, particularly in the negative direction (i.e., even in economic crises). In this way, Libra will function more like a currency board such as Hong Kong rather than a central bank. The collateral will consist of  deposits and government securities in currencies\\xa0from stable and reputable central banks, according to Facebook. The latter will be limited to  from stable governments\\xa0that are unlikely to experience high inflation. To make sure it can easily raise cash by selling this paper, it will all be  securities issued by these governments that are all traded in liquid markets. While the composition of the basket may change over time, Facebook said, the currency will always be fully backed, discouraging  on the bank that can happen with fractional reserve institutions. [12] To comply with anti-money-laundering regulations that require traceability of funds, transactions on the Libra blockchain will be unencrypted,  many other\\xa0blockchains, so it is possible for third parties to do analysis to detect and penalize fraud, Facebook said. In other words, it appears that there will be no use of cryptographic mechanisms such as zero-knowledge proofs, used to obscure transaction details in privacy-focused coins such as zcash. If that raises privacy concerns (particularly given Facebook own reputation with user data), the company is offering similar assurances to those Satoshi Nakamoto gave in the 2008\\xa0bitcoin white paper. [12] Customers It important to realize that Facebook is actually launching two cryptocurrencies: the one everyone talking about (Libra) and the one available only to Facebook and its corporate partners (the Libra investment token). The former will be backed by a basket of fiat currencies and cash equivalents, which means that for every dollar of Libra in existence, there will be (in theory) a  worth of real-world assets which that token may be exchanged for under certain conditions.\\xa0\\xa0 As a normal user, you get $100 worth of Libra by spending $100. Your Libra can (again, in theory) be used across a variety of platforms or sent to an approved friend.\\xa0 The Libra Association (a Swiss not-for-profit) puts your $100 into a variety f low-risk, short-term investments like U.S. Treasury bills. Those funds are controlled and spent by the Libra Association. According to the white paper, funds are used first to fund the operation of the network with the remainder being divided among the Libra Investment Token holders according to their holdings, with policies determined by the association.  The association itself is made up of holders of the Libra investment token who invested a minimum of $10 million, as well as  impact groups selected by the association to have a vote but who don have to buy the investment token. From the white paper:  will the reserve be invested? Users of Libra do not receive a return from the reserve. The reserve will be invested in low-risk assets that will yield interest over time. The revenue from this interest will first go to support the operating expenses of the association  to fund investments in the growth and development of the ecosystem, grants to nonprofit and multilateral organizations, engineering research, etc. Once that is covered, part of the remaining returns will go to pay dividends to early investors in the Libra Investment Token for their initial contributions. Because the assets in the reserve are low risk and low yield, returns for early investors will only materialize if the network is successful and the reserve grows substantially in size. [11] Early investors are primarily large technology and VC companies, for whom $10 million isn actually a huge investment. The big numbers come into play when you look at what success, big or small, would look like for the investors, at which point suddenly the project makes sense. [11] Consumers, who will decide ultimately\\xa0whether or not Libra is a flop, there was only a slightly underwhelming hint of what it might actually be used for: A picture of someone sending money to someone else via a smartphone. Even setting aside\\xa0the various risks\\xa0thrown up by the Libra white paper\\xa0(financial stability, user privacy, and whether it could cope with hundreds of millions of daily transactions), you have to ask why it might be a compelling product.\\xa0The service described by Facebook, namely sending money  you might send a text message, is already offered by plenty of other companies such as Alphabet Inc. Google, Apple Cash, PayPal Holdings Inc. Venmo and Circle, a peer-to-peer payments provider that lets you transfer traditional fiat currencies. Indeed, Facebook itself lets you send cash through its Messaging app. The company even had its own virtual currency before, called Credits, for the purchasing of content from within apps. It didn take off. Sweden, for example, is on the road to becoming cashless as soon as 2023. The local mobile payments service Swish was used by about 60 percent of Swedes in 2018, according to a Riksbank survey. It has more than 6.7 million users in the country. Facebook plans to lead the Libra consortium for the rest of 2019, and it will be at least five years before the blockchain technology that supports the tokens is completely decentralized. The ultimate dream of any crypto project worth its salt is that the digital currency doesn rely on a single point of control. And what about Facebook targeting of the  or those in the developing world struggling with volatile currencies? Bitcoin and its ilk promised to address the same problems, and have failed completely to help anyone other than speculators and criminals. Facebook own patchy record on international payments should give pause too. WhatsApp Pay has struggled to gain regulatory acceptance in India, the world top remittance market, because its data storage practices didn meet national standards. Libra will have to answer a lot of similar questions about its financial structure and treatment of customer information. Facebook has been on a mission over the past year to recapture the trust of its users. Libra certainly demands a lot of faith.[4] Another big question surrounding Libra is what kinds of consumer protections  if any  Facebook and its partners will build into the system. With bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, there are often few protections. Stories abound of people losing thousands or millions of dollars or more because they can't remember the passcode to their cryptocurrency wallet, or a hacker broke into their wallet or into the cryptocurrency exchange where it was stored. And typically, any transactions conducted using such digital currency are final once they happen. They can't be reversed because one party made a mistake or a customer didn't get what he or she ordered. Customers using the traditional banking system have many more protections. In the US, federal banking insurance covers deposits. Consumers generally have the right to contest charges or have transactions reversed if they didn't get what they've ordered or were defrauded. And they generally won't be held responsible if someone steals their credit card and uses it to make a bunch of purchases. It's unclear what model Facebook and its partners will follow with Libra. But it's likely that many customers and, perhaps, regulators are going to expect the company to offer similar protections that banks and credit card issuers offer. [6] Libra is still in the early stages of development with lots of things left to do, with a targeted launch in early 2020. However, Libra is perhaps the most ambitious and hyped cryptocurrency in existence, drawing on the stature of Facebook as a unicorn, as well as the partnerships that have been developed by the Libra association. With plans to create a fully-functioning blockchain that is open-source, and facilitates smart contract technology using a native programming language, Libra seems to be moving in fundamentally the right direction. More importantly, the adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology by a giant technology firm has set the tone for mainstream adoption of this nascent technology, and the fact that a prominent list of institutions, all of which were previously openly reluctant to embrace cryptocurrencies, serve as members of the Libra association, is a huge testament to the changing tides of acceptance towards distributed ledger technologies.

       "  'Interest in the dWeb is blossoming, but decentralized systems require cooperation in order to work. If Richard Hendricks dream of the new internet is to come to fruition, it going to mean we relying on our friends, neighbors, and even strangers to provide us with information and connection to the outside world. It going to take communities of ultra-cooperation to work. But can we rely on networks of people (some or all of whom are self-interested) to deliver? Call me the optimist, but I think humans actually have the necessary \"stuff\" to make it work well. Here, I lay out some of our evolved moral fabric, and how that moral fabric can be tailored to socially scale the decentralized web. Cooperation refers to win-win interactions among peers. This is in contrast to one person dominating from a transaction at the expense of the other (cooperation is not altruism or free-riding). One of the most common forms of cooperation is direct reciprocity,  give me this, and I give you that. Reciprocity is an incredibly strong ethic in humans that Benjamin Franklin picked up when dolling out perhaps a surprising piece of wisdom:  you want to make a friend, ask for a favor. This is effective because it makes future interactions more likely; the person who gave you a favor is more likely to seek you out and ask for a return favor. This back-and-forth keeps the social balance-sheet open.\\xa0 Salespeople and charitieshave also picked up on the effectiveness of appealing to our ethic ofreciprocity. Perhaps you received personalized address labels or cute kitten calendars in the mail gift accompanied by a pre-stamped donation return envelope. This reciprocity creates social capital that helps us all survive. We all come out ahead when we return favors, or when we collaborate to accomplish something that impossible to achieve alone. Studies of primates have revealed that cooperation is generally paid out with equitable resources to encourage future interaction instance, if primates hunt big game  together, the monkeys which accomplish capturing the game tend to receive more of the meat than the other primates who participated, but were less pivotal. This equitable reimbursement ensures that those primates continue to have buddies to hunt with in the future. Nobody wants to include selfish, meat-hoarding monkeys on their hunts. Humans have evolved reciprocity to an even greater degree. But, as this example may imply, constant cooperation is not a foolproof technique to ensure one own (or even the whole species survival. Constant cooperation is exploitable, it only takes one free-rider to ruin its effectiveness by stripping the  cooperators of their resources. This was the downfall of Napster predecessor, Gnutella. Gnutella got around the centralized directory that Napster relied on, but did so by assuming that its user base would cooperatively upload files online as requests from other users came along. Unfortunately, it only takes a few free-riders to ruin it for the cooperators. In the case of Gnutella, there were a lot: the vast majority of their user base would request music, but wouldn upload music. The burden became too heavy for the cooperative users, and Gnutella largely fell apart. It had a faulty premise about human nature: we don\\'t always cooperate. In fact, even when it seems to be in out best interest, humans aren  cooperators. Today, game theorists illustrate this issue with the prisoner dilemma. Two partners in crime are arrested on minor charges and questioned separately. They are told if they rat out their partner on a larger crime (and their partner stays quiet), they will walk out free. If they both stay quiet, they will receive only light prison time for the minor charges. If, however, their partner rats them out for the larger crime, too, then they will face a long prison sentence. In a single round of the prisoner dilemma, people tend to stop cooperating with their crime partner and this results in a bad situation: long prison sentences for both prisoners. Perhaps obviously, behaviors in the prisoner dilemma change dramatically if players are required to play multiple rounds with the same partner. That is, we more likely to cooperate with each other when we stuck with each other for the foreseeable future. Evolutionarily, we want to keep our ingroups happy, because we partially depend on them for our survival. (Don make the one guy who knows how to make fire mad at you just before winter But, if always cooperating is exploitable, and making people mad is bad for business what the right balance? The mathematical psychologist Anatol Rapoport developed an algorithm that won a tournament of repeated prisoner dilemma games and largely solved the cooperation strategy problem. His solution operates off a familiar principle: Tit-for-Tat. Cooperation between peers is maximized according to these simple rules: 1.\\xa0Cooperate on first interactions with a stranger. 2.\\xa0On subsequent interactions, copy what the other player did  (cooperate/defect) in the prior round. That it. If two peers play according to this algorithm, they will always cooperate. If one of the players doesn use this algorithm, they experience punishment until they change their ways. Thus, the initially uncooperative peer is incentivized to cooperate in future interactions. Bram Cohen, who created the now popular BitTorrent protocol, used the Tit-for-Tat principle as its backbone. Gnutella transferred whole files between peers at a time, effectively operating as a single round of the prisoner dilemma. By breaking files up into small bits, BitTorrent forced the file transfer process into one of a repeated prisoner dilemma. As user download pieces of their target file from a given swarm of others, they simultaneously upload pieces of files to the peers from whom they downloaded the most data recently. In contrast to Gnutella, BitTorrent successfully coordinated cooperative file-transferring, and once boasted managing 43% of internet traffic.  But holdup problem of peer-to-peer connections hasn been totally alleviated. These sorts of \"cooperation\" algorithms are still exploitable if the assumptions they are based on are faulty if the repeated rounds aspect is questionable. One way this assumption can be violated in P2P algorithms is when groups are sufficiently large, such that free-riders can effectively avoid repeat rounds of cooperation dilemmas. The tit-for-tat principle doesn work very well in large groups, because you can trade  partners without fear that you run out of  to interact with. If everybody follows rule #1 of the Tit-for-Tat principle, then free-riders can take advantage of initial cooperation by interacting with others exactly one time. And we actually saw algorithmic responses to BitTorrent which would allow you to download files without uploading files by constantly finding new  from which to download the next needed file pieces (without needing to give file pieces back). One example of this is BitThief. The internet is nothing if not a massive group. There no shortage of  cooperative  online. So now what? The dWeb requires, by definition, large groups of people. Well, one option is for large groups to evolve a collective ethic of punishing people who have harmed others (not just punishing those who harm the self). But in order to do this, humans would need to be able to detect free-riders. As it turns out, humans are very sensitive to detecting cheaters so than they are sensitive to similar unfair outcomes happening by  For instance, babies as young as 15 months are surprised when a person distributes goods unequally (i.e. when people who put the same levels of work in get different payoffs) but show no such surprise when the unfair outcome is distributed via non-conscious actions (i.e. physical constraints of the environment cause the \"unfair\" payoffs). But detecting cheaters isn enough to deter them, they must actually punish free-riders. And, indeed, people interacting in large groups also conferred reproductive advantages by enacting third-party punishment. That is, humans evolved to punish people for wrongdoing, even when the wrongdoing was not directed at themselves. This tendency has been confirmed by psychological studies: not only are humans willing to punish third-party bad actors, but they are willing to incur personal cost to do so, and experience pleasure in correcting third-party free-riders in spite of these costs. But we still aren\\'t home free. One unique challenge the digital world has faced in detecting and subsequently punishing cheaters is reputation management. Individuals in large groups can protect themselves from third party punishments if their identities are unknown. Two common approaches to online reputation management include Sybil attacks (one person creates multiple accounts to boost their online popularity) and white-washing (a person opens a new account in order to shed a bad reputation on their old account). Decentralized identity platforms like Sovrin or Iris may help get around this by making it sufficiently difficult to re-create new identities, though it is unlikely that any platform can be completely immune from these reputation management schemes. Recently there have been a number of suggestions for making peers in a decentralized network offer up some sort of  which can be  or \"slashed\" in the event punitive action needs to be taken against a troll or free-rider. The logic is that people won free-ride or otherwise be uncooperative if doing so incurs a cost to themselves. Alongside digital identity, stake-slashing offers a potential solution to such bad actors, because stake could theoretically be burned before they have an opportunity to withdraw from a platform. But these sorts of suggestions need to be considered gingerly, particularly for social networks.  Humans are prone to enacting revenge, and bad actors could, in turn, burn the stakes of innocent others to discredit their punishers. This can create a regression of stake-burning, anti-social behavior the exact opposite of what the dWeb needs. There is potential to curb such stake-burning by requiring the punisher to incur a cost themselves even this suggestion should be implemented with caution. As noted previously, people don mind incurring some small costs for the pleasure of punishing bad actors. Online, the potential pool of punishers is large, and it wouldn be inconceivable for micropunishments from numerous third parties to become far too harsh. Punishments should probably be local in some sense the free-rider is punished only in the context of the relationship between the wrong-doer and the punisher, not globally across a protocol. Another consideration in bad-actor detection is allowing for a margin of error. Humans are pretty bad at reading tone and intention in online communications. It not difficult to imagine a miscommunication occurring in which one party burns another stake after misunderstanding what was intended. Likewise, peers on a network that accidentally go down might look as though they are free-riding. For instance, if a peer involved in a BitTorrent protocol went down multiple times, honest nodes might think that peer is using BitTheif and throw them off the network.  Fortunately, the evolution of morals also gives us tips about how we might handle these sorts of cooperation  and previous bad actors turned cooperative: forgiveness. Forgiveness is clearly seen throughout human social functioning, but it also rampant in chimpanzees and bonobos as well. Primatologist Frans DeWall has noted that primates, after a fight, are often seen extending hands to one another, and offering comfort in the form of hugs or sex. Typically, reparations are initiated on the part of the bad actor (or the peer who did the questionable behavior of going offline). And there is computational evidence to back up the usefulness of forgiveness mechanisms: simulation studies have revealed that resources are maximized in groups which instill some sort of program of forgiveness. In fact, forgiveness is the only performance tweak to the tit-for-tat protocol that I am aware of. It called  tit-for-tat, and it not hard to see why it offers an improvement in the real, messy world of misunderstandings and hardware malfunctions. Imagine that you playing a repeated round of the prisoner dilemma. Things seem to be going well, and both you and your partner are operating on the original tit-for-tat principle. Then, all of a sudden, you go offline. When you come back online and interact with the peer, a funny thing happens: they screw you over. What neither of you realize is that they thought you screwed them over when you went offline, so they are returning your free-riding favor. Now since you both run on tit-for-tat, you stuck in an infinite loop of not cooperating. Generous tit-for-tat offers a simple tweak: if your partner is uncooperative, frequently (but don\\'t always) reciprocate. This forgiveness tweak allows the peers to restore cooperation in the future, thus extracting mutual benefits once more. A quick word about  I like the idea, but I about our ability to deliver trustless algorithms. Cryptocurrencies, despite being heralded as trustless, are simply not (yet) trustless. 51% attack aside, double-spending is still a problem for relatively new transactions in which a fork can overtake the main chain the advice to  six blocks before delivering a good or service. Even if all of the (many) cryptocurrency attacks are patched, these transactions are meant to reflect what happened in the not-so-trustless world. This is partly why multi-sig and transaction mediator systems have emerged. These mediator businesses indicate a trust issue in my opinion. So long as the dWeb is used to enhance connectivity of humans, trust is relevant. Much of the dWeb technology is new, and I cannot say for certain whether full trustlessness is achievable. However, I can say that we humans have evolved to use trust as a tool for expanding our potential via cooperation. And we come a long way. While we slowly improving our algorithms of  I hope some of the evolved moral-social tendencies I outlined can be implemented into our algorithms as well. We humans are pretty savvy about navigating mesh networks. Afterall, we naturally are one.

       "  'While traditional finance, which includes banking, investment, and insurance, has been around for at least a century, the digital currency market is relatively younger. Bitcoin, the first ever cryptocurrency, was released in January 2009 and did not gain much traction outside enthusiast communities until a couple years later. Over the past few years, however, applications of the technology have proliferated, with major technology companies such as IBM and Microsoft exploring its use cases to augment or replace existing financial processes.\\r According to data from CoinMarketCap, the cumulative market capitalization of the crypto asset class is approaching $275 billion. A significant portion of this valuation comes from the crypto market potential to be used as a hedge against the prevailing economic system. Countries like Venezuela that are currently grappling with long-standing economic turmoil and inflation are a prime example of this.\\r Citizens of Venezuela and Zimbabwe have overwhelmingly turned to digital assets because their local fiat currencies depreciate significantly every minute. While Zimbabweans used foreign currencies, including the US dollar, in the past, their physical availability in the country has always been an issue.\\r Bitcoin, and other such cryptocurrencies, do not face this problem as they are truly global and accessible over the Internet. Anyone can create a Bitcoin wallet and transact with other users on the network, regardless of borders and geopolitical restrictions.\\r This unprecedented free movement of value has many benefits for banks and traditional financial institutions as well, since the underlying blockchain technology can be leveraged to make cross-border transactions more inexpensive and efficient.\\r Noticing blockchain immense potential, institutional investors have started to take note of specific digital assets and the general industry. Cryptocurrency exchanges, which offer the easiest way for investors to purchase digital assets using fiat currencies, have also reported that institutional involvement in the market has been on the rise.\\r In a blog post published May 2018, American cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase said, Coinbase has been at the forefront of introducing new cryptocurrency products geared towards non-consumer and institutional audiences, including custodial services such as Coinbase Custody and professional-grade trading tools in the form of Coinbase Prime. Simultaneously, other exchanges have also been attempting to innovate and attract more institutional wealth to the market. Gemini, an exchange owned by the Winklevoss twins, is attempting to introduce the first ever Bitcoin ETF (Exchange Traded Fund), pending approval from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\\r Outside the US, countries like Japan and South Korea are pioneering cryptocurrency adoption by passing legislation that either recognizes digital assets as legal tender or providing a regulatory framework for blockchain and cryptocurrency businesses and startups to follow.\\r As with traditional stock markets, institutional investment tends to stick around for longer than a few months. While consumers and retail investors might liquidate their holdings for emergencies or during periods of volatility, hedge fund managers and institutional investors tend to hold a more long-term position. It is likely as a result of this persistent demand that cryptocurrency prices have been trending upwards lately.\\r Anthony Pompliano, co-founder of crypto hedge fund firm, Morgan Creek Digital, explained why institutional traders are increasingly starting to venture into the cryptocurrency space. In an interview with Cointelegraph in July 2019, he said, During an appearance on CNBC  Trader segment, Pompliano gave the world a glimpse at how hedge fund managers are approaching the crypto market. He said, While institutional demand has undoubtedly increased, global consumer adoption of cryptocurrencies has been steadily climbing as well. This is best exemplified by the fact that major tech companies, including Samsung and HTC, have integrated digital asset wallets within their consumer electronics devices. Samsung Galaxy S10 lineup of smartphones, for instance, comes with a  Wallet on-board that is also compatible with several ERC-20 tokens and decentralized applications (DApps). The universal availability of crypto wallets within every single smartphone has the potential to make retail payments using crypto much more accessible.\\r Similarly, DApps like Alluva are boosting adoption by offering everyone the ability to earn rewards for predicting future prices of cryptocurrencies. Unlike trading, where users have to invest in the tokens directly and have expertise dealing with minute fluctuations, Alluva allows users to predict at absolutely zero risk. Users that make accurate predictions are rewarded in the form of Alluva tokens (ALV). These tokens can either be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies on a supported exchange (provided you are legally permitted to do so in your region), or exchanged for products and services at Alluva range of upcoming partners and online store.\\r While many believe that traditional finance and the banking system are distancing themselves from the cryptocurrency market, the facts tell us a different story. With institutional interest and investment on the rise, we may truly witness the golden age of the crypto and blockchain sectors soon enough.',\n",
       "  'Several years ago, Bitcoin was a relatively unknown phenomenon and only people ahead of the tech curve were mining and exchanging it on a regular basis. By 2017, that all changed, and Bitcoin\\xa0skyrocketed from around $900 to over $20,000. Optimists in the crowd might have guessed that within a few years, its trajectory would continue to grow unabated, and we all be using Bitcoin (or some kind of cryptocurrency) for everything from paying our bills to buying groceries. Consumers began clamoring to get a piece of the Bitcoin profit machine. Overnight millionaires populated headlines (and\\xa0are still generating attention today), and hesitant investors on the sidelines began debating whether they should jump in at $20,000 or wait for a drop. That drop eventually came, of course, as Bitcoin now hovers around $8,000. Sensationalist news stories the world over had unintentionally introduced Bitcoin not as a form of currency, but as a get rich quick scheme. And the ripple effect from this introduction is still hurting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies growth. What wrong with investing? Let start by reiterating the real purpose of cryptocurrency: it a currency, designed to be used to buy and sell goods and services. A currency is only valuable if it both\\xa0believed to be inherently valuable\\xa0by the population using it and used on a regular basis. When people treat Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as an investment opportunity, rather than a currency, they inclined to either use a  and hold strategy, purchasing a finite amount of Bitcoin and waiting for it to grow in value, or a market timing strategy, buying and selling Bitcoin with other investors, keeping the supply flow relatively limited. Every person using Bitcoin this way will, necessarily, remove some amount of Bitcoin from circulating where it should  in the open marketplace. Crypto being used to buy and sell consumer products, or to pay bills, will increase the public faith in cryptocurrency, and introduce it to new people who may not be ready to use it yet. Keeping it in your wallet robs it of that potential power. There are also secondary ripple effects to keep in mind here. When investors contribute a level of activity to an asset that exceeds its volume-based tolerance, the price of the asset tends to get volatile, and fast. Lots of investors excited about buying the asset will drive prices far higher than they should naturally go, especially in uncharted territory (like cryptocurrency). In some cases, this creates a snowball effect; skyrocketing prices incentivizes even more investors to get involved, since they see it as a massive opportunity for profit., and they push prices even higher. Sound familiar? It what happened to Bitcoin at the end of 2017, and is the same activity responsible for\\xa0developing economic bubbles. Sooner or later, that bubble bursts, and all the artificially inflated value of the asset is lost within a relatively short period of time. This is problematic for several reasons, including the fact that it prevents crypto from finding a steady, reliable price. It also presents an image of volatility and unreliability to the general public  who need to believe in the dependability of the currency if they ever going to be expected to use it. Things are made even more complicated by the news media, which jumped on Bitcoin as an exciting opportunity to talk about a sensational up-and-coming technology. While some outlets delved deep into the blockchain roots of cryptocurrency with a realistic perspective on how it could be used in the future, most only reported on it as an investment opportunity. This framing created a feedback loop; more investors got involved, pushing the price artificially higher, which led to more  millionaires, which in turn led to even more sensationalist media reporting. It arguable that investors have some marginal positive impact on crypto growth, since they do bring attention to the blockchain, but there are far more events and strategies that would have a much more positive impact: If cryptocurrency is going to serve its true purpose  functioning as a secure, nationally agnostic form of fiat currency  we need to lose the mentality that it a smart investment (or a dumb investment). We need fewer people checking the price of Bitcoin daily and more people spending Bitcoin daily. We need businesses accepting the currency, rather than buying and holding it as a long-term retirement plan. We need more activity and less stagnation.',\n",
       "  'Last month, Facebook finally disclosed details of its much-hyped cryptocurrency, Libra. After generating an immense amount of chatter, the company announced that the digital currency, set to launch in 2020, will enable people to buy things or send money to others with almost zero fees.  Facebook plans to build its own wallet that will be integrated into WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and its app. Cryptocurrencies have been in the fintech space for quite some time - over 1,600 cryptocurrencies are in circulation - but till date, Libra enjoys the largest financial backing amongst them.\\xa0 Albeit the hype, what stood out were Facebook intentions regarding their users digital identities.\\xa0  additional goal of the association is to develop and promote an open identity standard. We believe that decentralized and portable digital identity is a prerequisite to financial inclusion and competition, the whitepaper highlighted. In a digital environment where you don know if the person you interacting with is indeed who they claim to be, a large amount of data and personal information may be collected by businesses to verify the user true identity. In an attempt to guard themselves against fraud, the vast amount of users personal data may run the risk of identity theft and spying. One of the ways to tackle this problem is to enable the user with control over their data.\\xa0 However, plans that target a self-sovereign identity are not underway yet, although the social media giant CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that he was exploring the option earlier this year. The company is also considering a decentralized digital identity standard, but the disclosure made researchers wary of how open the digital identity standard would be.\\xa0  more commerce happens, then more small businesses will sell more on and off platform, and they want to buy more ads on the platform so it will be good for our ads business, remarked David Marcus, Facebook VP of blockchain. The bigger threat of muscling in on user data\\xa0 When it launches, it will most likely be the first cryptocurrency wallet that would interact with over a billion people - largely because it\\'s tied to Facebook\\'s ecosystem. Tapping into their data through this will open a new channel for monetization. The tech company is largely driven by advertisements - with nearly $15 billion in ad revenue for their recent quarter, by harvesting and monetizing data.  With Libra, Facebook would have access to purchase data of its users. If the tech company were to monitor the transactions, it would learn exactly what people are buying and may tap into that information for monetization. There would be several privacy concerns if the cryptocurrency ran on a public ledger like many others - including Bitcoin. A public ledger could expose the data, permitting an outsider to use pattern recognition technologies and artificial intelligence to identify the users making the transactions.  Lawmakers and regulators expressed mistrust of the company\\'s new cryptocurrency plan, pointing out to the Facebook\\'s pattern of failing to keep consumer data private and infringing on their privacy.\\xa0  five data points might be enough [for a company] to say,  pretty sure that this identity that anonymized on the Libra ledger is Wayne Vaughan because he purchased something of this amount at this store at this time, explained Wayne Vaughan, co-founder of the Decentralized Identity Foundation.\\xa0  [the firm] can search the entire public ledger for a set of data for all the transactions that are associated with that identity, he said. Libra may provide Facebook with the option to use the wallet to tap into financial services and advertise or sell products on the platform. It\\'s a whole new business opportunity for Facebook.\\xa0\\xa0 Phil Windley from the Sovrin Foundation also highlighted that  does not imply that the user has control over their data. It could mean that the user identity information will be spread across Libra blockchain.\\xa0  often use decentralized as an unalloyed gilt and just assume that it means everything is going to be great. That could be what they are doing here  just using  as a synonym for  he highlighted. Days after Facebook disclosed plans of making Libra a payment solution, regulators called on the company to halt any further development until the authorities investigated its implications to the global financial system.  products and services like these are left improperly regulated and without sufficient oversight, they could pose systemic risks that endanger global financial stability, Rep. Maxine Waters wrote in a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.  vulnerabilities could be exploited and obscured by bad actors, as other cryptocurrencies, exchanges and wallets have been in the past, she said. After the Federal Reserve and regulators raised serious concerns over Libra\\'s financial stability, privacy and consumer protection, officials from other countries including Singapore have demanded a more thorough investigation of Facebook\\'s proposal. Democrats have raised calls for Facebook to clean up its past and be very transparent before moving on to Libra and the Fed\\'s Chairman said that Libra \"cannot go forward\" until Facebook examines the regulatory challenges it will face.\\xa0 This makes us question if Facebook will succeed with their cryptocurrency plan and if we really need (or want) Facebook to rethink money.',\n",

Especially in our times where even the president of the United States has an opinion about the cryptocurrency, expressed in Dorsey social platform. Jacks companies have been involved with bitcoin since 2014 when Square started allowing its merchants to accept bitcoin. Ever since Cash App allowed customers to purchase bitcoin in 2017, Square Crypto was born this year, and Bitcoin Salaries reported his 43,700 Satoshis salary in 2019.

       "  \"Do you care about the security of your messages, emails, and the files that you send online? That great if you do, because the Internet is full of dangers and leaks can damage anyone reputation. Good examples are Hillary Clinton or the celebrities whose private photos were leaked, both situations showing us that security is nothing to joke about.\\xa0 The majority of popular data transfer methods can be secure, if used properly and with precautions. But in this article we're going to review most of them from a technical standpoint to find out where they stop being as secure as they claim to be. In this context, we also cover the advanced blockchain technologies that solve the problem of security in digital transfers to understand if decentralization covers the shortcomings of the current solutions. Source: xkcd.com The most common channel of communication we use is the ordinary email. It's plain text sent by an SMTP server to the POP server. Its biggest vulnerability is to sniffing  when you suddenly get a middleman spying on your traffic and reading everything you send. The problem can be fixed by using a P2P-encrypted email service, such as ProtonMail and many others. These email providers allow the encryption of all outgoing mail messages with your own unique password. Recipients can read your mail by also using that password, and those who don know the password will only see the meaningless, jumbled text. This is one way to send emails securely, but still you can get a certain confirmation that the receiving party actually received it, and you can send large files via email either. Another channel of communication we use everyday is messengers, the most popular of them being Telegram and WhatsApp. These apps are more secure than email by default, as they include end-to-end encryption right from the start. Telegram has its own encryption protocol, MTProto, which is open sourced, so everyone can check the code and its security, and WhatsApp uses Signal, another popular encryption protocol that is free-to-use. This protocol, however, is more inconsistent in its performance. A security site, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, made a series of detailed reviews regarding the flaws of both messengers, and they came to the conclusion that WhatsApp might be more flawed than its competitor, Telegram:\\xa0 Another solution for data transfer is cloud storage. There are many competing services, such as Dropbox, Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive. Generally, they are secure. Every large storage platform, at least these three, have advanced external firewalls, internal firewalls, intrusion detection, event logging, and encryption. Also, all data centers where the files are stored are protected - armed guards, fingerprints, access levels. However, many users are still susceptible to phishing attacks; they still give passwords to hackers. In addition, security-oriented people may be concerned by the fact that all data in public clouds is stored together and they don have any control over its storage. And let not forget about the fact that it always hard to download a large file (over 4 GB) via a slow HTTPS connection. The above examples serve us well in everyday life. They are convenient to use, as we typically don need high security when sending our cat photo to our parents. As an alternative, you can use specialized software designed especially for handling a high volume of transactional data, such as Microsoft Azure or BitTorrent.\\xa0 Gartner, a global research and advisory firm, has named Microsoft Azure a leader in enterprise cloud solutions in 2019. The solution by Microsoft offers a wide range of services, from storing files to deploying cloud applications for your business. One of its services, Rights Management System (RMS), is a special security-oriented encryption system for setting permissions to access stored files. Overall, it a very large ecosystem that has several advantages, but there are also a few major disadvantages.\\xa0 Pros:\\xa0 Cons: Source: someecards.com Speaking of  there also the BitTorrent software, the most popular file-sharing software in the world. The whole file-sharing activity accounts for 3% of global downstream and 22% of upstream traffic, and 97% of that traffic is from BitTorrent, according to a study by Sandvine in 2018. BitTorrent can be used not only to illegally download games and movies, but also as a genuine peer-to-peer service. Its decentralized protocol allows users to directly share various files between two parties without the need for any middle man. Simply create a magnet link to your file, and send it to another user - that enough to transfer a file.\\xa0 Pros: Cons:\\xa0 In some special situations (for example, sending an NDA document or an unreleased movie) you would probably want to control who is downloading your files and how well it is protected. In this case we would need a decentralized encrypted blockchain solution that would only give you full control over your files.\\xa0 Why would you need a blockchain service to transfer your files? Don forget, our privacy is shrinking. The Snowden scandal revealed that all our actions are under global surveillance, so it would be wise to try to keep at least some part of our activities from the eyes of the curious government, hackers, and other prying eyes. Blockchain technology was created as a response to this surveillance, which is why they continue to be perfected in the sense of security and privacy.\\xa0 Over the past three years, a few prominent blockchain solutions for secure data transfer and storage were created, such as Authpaper Delivery, Filecoin, and Storj. All of them offer a distributed network of nodes that can be used to store encrypted data, which can be read only by having a special cryptographic key. All of them have similar features, but the most advanced is Authpaper Delivery, as it allows for the storage and transfer of data alongside the ability to control the delivery. It even uses an already existing BitTorrent network instead of building its own from scratch. But now let check out the finer details. Source: theatlas.com As we said before, Authpaper Delivery is based on the BitTorrent protocol but with very important tweaks. Their solution allows users to send encrypted files over the network as easily as the regular torrent files. The recipients who have the download link can get it and decrypt the file using two private keys. Those who don have the keys can download the file, but they can read its content. The platform allows users to send very large files as well, as it supported by the underlying BitTorrent protocol, so it can be used to transfer any types of files, from classified documents to unreleased movies, without the fear of making a Wolverine-sized leak.\\xa0 Every action related to the sent file is documented, being written to the Authpaper Delivery ledger. The BitTorrent network nodes, who take on an extra role of file keepers in Authpaper ecosystem, also verify and record all operations on data and its delivery. Additionally, they verify the consistency of the file. To keep them motivated in storing the data without the ability to read it, they are paid with the platform tokens, Authpaper coins (AUPC). It works like this: This whole cycle is secure; it divides file to many pieces, it divides QR codes with private keys into many pieces, and it ensures that the confidential file won stay uploaded after the delivery, as the seeds will almost immediately delete it to clear up hard drive space. At the same time, the record of the delivery will stay in the Authpaper Delivery blockchain forever. So it a great solution, as anyone can use it to send files without having to be concerned about the integrity of the process.\\xa0 Everyday we face the inevitable necessity to protect our private data from curious eyes. It's a non-stop game where two parties try to outsmart each other. One party tries to get your data for some benefit, and you don't want them to. Any method of sending information via the Internet can be very secure if some precautions are made. Also, anyone can be hacked, it depends only on the effort put into finding a breach. That's why the decentralized solutions for transferring files privately and verifying them have become far more popular.\",\n",
       "  'Price rallies are the highlight of any asset class and cryptocurrencies are not the exception. Bitcoin has made more news based on its unpredictable price rallies than for any other of its recent developments. During and after a price rally we would hear all sorts of speculative arguments about its causes and expected behaviors but sometimes we ignore the most obvious data points. Like many other events in a cryptocurrency network, price rallies leave fingerprints in the underlying blockchains. Today, I would like to highlight some non-trivial examples of indicators and analyses that can help us understand price rallies based on its on-chain behaviors. Analyzing the behavior of price rallies on-chain can be relevant for several reasons. For starters, on-chain signals can demystify some of the subjective, speculative analyses that are formulated after a price rally. More importantly, understanding patterns within on-chain indicators can help identify relevant conditions that can serve as predictors of a new price rally. With some exceptions, most price rallies are unexpected events and, therefore, trigger the best of our imagination in order to come up with plausible explanations about its causes. Price rallies are important events to frame the investor behavior and psychology of any crypto-asset. While the structured processes of public markets and the control mechanisms of equities exchanges provide clear mechanisms to explain and even-constraint the effects of a price rally, those dynamics are completely different in crypto. Borrowing some ideas from behavioral psychology, we can describe price rallies in crypto assets in three different stages: Differently from other asset classes, crypto-assets record many events of their lifecycle in publicly available blockchains. When comes to price rallies, studying on-chain data can be one of the most effective ways to understand the effects and behavior of price rallies. In financial markets, there are three fundamental types of indicators that are used to understand a given asset class: Understanding the on-chain behavior of crypto-assets cannot only help to clearly understand how price rallies are reflected on blockchains but also identify clear conditions that will signal a new price rally. Blockchains provide a universe of data that helps us understand the mechanics of price rallies. Using data science as an enabler, we can provide some unique indicators that are relevant to large price fluctuations in crypto-assets. One of the clear signs of a price rally is the number of token holders that materialize gains. The In-Out Money Analysis reveals the distribution of token holders making money versus those loosing money. After a price rally, we should see the number and size of the clusters in green increase. If we compare the results of the indicator for Bitcoin (that has seen some relevant price rallies recently) and Ethereum, we can see some drastic contrasts. Source:\\xa0http://intotheblock.com The thing about In-Out of the Money indicators is that they can be both lagging but also leading as the sign a position for the next price rally. New investors is often one of the omnipresent elements of any price rally. Measuring the number of new and active addresses on a given crypto-network can help to understand the impact of new investors in a previous price rally as well as the conditions for new price movements. The Traders Analysis reveals an increasing number of new addresses created by recent price rallies in Litecoin.  Source:\\xa0http://intotheblock.com Large investors(whales) are typically associated with price rallies. In some tokens, whales act mostly as passive investors while, in others, they trade actively causing fluctuations in the price. The Whales Activity Analysis shows the trading activity of large investors. That analysis in Bitcoin Cash looks like the following: Source:\\xa0http://intotheblock.com One of the clear signs of a price rally is the increase in number of active addresses. In any price rally, we should see a growing number of active addresses as well as new addresses coming into the network. The Address analysis shows the number of active, new and zero-balance address and you can see how it look very healthy for Ethereum. Source:\\xa0http://intotheblock.com Large on-chain transactions are typically signs of large transfers that can be used to take a sizable position in an asset or also the aggregation of a large number of smaller transactions. During price rallies both indicators tend to increase distinctively. Source:\\xa0http://intotheblock.com The analysis of on-chain data is not very obvious and is difficult to achieve at scale. However, when comes to price rallies, on-chain datasets provide some of the richest and more accurate data points to help us understand the behavior and predict conditions for future rallies.',\n",
       "  'Google became popular by taking a nebulous, disorganized, and opaque landscape (the internet) and making it easily searchable. Now, the tech giant wants to do the same thing for a similarly novel technological advancement: the blockchain. Earlier this year, Google announced its deployment of a\\xa0suite of open source tools\\xa0for developers to better understand the blockchain as it relates to cryptocurrency. As part of the\\xa0BigQuery Public Datasets\\xa0program, Google had previously released public datasets for the transaction history of both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Now, there are six other cryptocurrencies in the mix: Bitcoin Cash, Dash, Ethereum Classic, Litecoin, Zcash, and of course, the most important cryptocurrency,\\xa0Dogecoin. Most of these cryptocurrencies are considered to be a part of the  family, because they built similarly to Bitcoin, which itself was developed by a person or group under the mysterious pseudonym  Nakamoto. So what exactly do these tools do, and why are they so important? Google is essentially doing two things for the eight cryptocurrencies in its suite. First, it making the datasets public; in other words, it categorizing and publicizing the full transaction data for each of these blockchains. Second, it launching new search tools to make it easier to explore these data. The software itself is called Blockchain ETL (extract, transform, load), primarily created by Medvedev, an independent developer. This system\\xa0scans for patterns in transaction flows, relying on machine learning to form conclusions about how the cryptocurrency address has been used in the past. It updates every 24 hours via a common codebase. How could this be useful? For starters, this could be helpful in determining whether or not an address is being used as part of a cryptocurrency mining pool. In a mining pool, many users each contribute a small fraction of their computer processing power. This cumulative power is then applied to audit blockchain transactions, thereby  new cryptocurrency, and the proceeds are often distributed to the contributors (with a central authority taking a cut). In the near future, a tool like this could readily identify a series of crypto addresses owned by an exchange, and consolidate them so they can be treated as a single entity. Also, because all datasets are structured with a standardized,  schema, it possible to make apples-to-apples comparisons across datasets. For example, you might be able to compare spikes in trading volume between Ethereum and Bitcoin. A tool known as  entry book view makes it easier to find the cumulative balance of an account as well, helping users discover an account balance with eight decimal places of accuracy. Much of the value from these tools will be applied to understanding\\xa0the economics of cryptocurrency. For example, how does the mining economy function, and how much value can it return? How do pricing fluctuations manifest, and what are their root causes? How do giant entities control ownership and/or manipulate the market? How do various cryptocurrencies relate to each other, and play into the economy at large? In the near future, as cryptocurrencies become even better established, tools like these can solve even more complex economic problems, like\\xa0calculating the Gini Index, a statistical measure of wealth distribution and economic inequality. If you plan on using these tools, your first terabyte of inquiry will be free every month. Beyond that terabyte, you face a per-byte fee or a $40,000 monthly rate for extreme high-volume users. Already, high-profile users are exploring new dimensions of cryptocurrency flows. For example, engineer Will Price has used Google BigQuery to study and\\xa0categorize 40,000 of the richest Ethereum addresses, ultimately coming up with 10 unique patterns for how those addresses were being used. Miners, exchanges, and ICO wallets were easy to identify, but the other 7 remain a bit of a mystery. One of the advantages of cryptocurrency is that it enables a layer of privacy for buyers and sellers, without robbing them of the security of their transaction. In general, privacy and transparency operate on a binary spectrum; the more private an institution is, the less transparent the data will be for analysts. Google new tools allow for the best of both worlds. Because the individual users (and entities) are still anonymized, Google empowers developers to mine transaction data without ever betraying who buying and selling on an individual basis. Google, like most of its competitors (including Amazon and Microsoft), is serious about making the most of the blockchain. The company already has more than 20 blockchain-related patents, and seems to reveal\\xa0new ones on a regular basis. With a better understanding of how the blockchain works, Google could easily integrate the blockchain\\xa0into its current search engine algorithm. In the words of Tim Carter of\\xa0SEO agency, SEO.co,  engine algorithms have previously ranked sites through a combination of hundreds of weighted factors, none of which currently include blockchain-powered immutability. If (and more likely, when) Google decides to implement distributed ledger into its search algorithm, it will do more than just squash internet content spam, it will further consolidate the trust, legitimacy, and power of the web largest internet assets. Google could even go the Facebook route and try to\\xa0launch a cryptocurrency of its own, raising ethical and regulatory questions about corporate control over blockchain-based currencies. For example, would these big tech companies have full access to your transaction data? How would the emergence of these cryptocurrencies affect banking and day-to-day transaction expectations? Would Facebook and Google need to be regulated the way our financial institutions are? In the meantime, we can all be grateful these data analytics tools are open source, and available to developers all over the world. The better we understand how cryptocurrencies are being used, the better we can refine the technology, and eventually, we develop a better understanding of economics as a whole.',\n",
       "  'Onboarding is the process of making active customers out of users of your product or service. For a company to be able to win new customers, its onboarding process must be top-notch. And in a world where\\xa0one can expect up to 90% of cryptocurrency startups to\\xa0fail, being among the succeeding 10% would take extra effort. The same principles guide the various onboarding processes across the board. But an emphasis on cryptocurrency is necessary because of its uniqueness. Despite the now-growing popularity of digital currencies, many still don know how they work because of the complex nature of cryptocurrency and blockchain. It should be noted that when it comes to onboarding, the organization can only have guiding principles but not hard rules. That because each company is unique in its own way and has to adapt its strategies to its areas of strength. Here are 10 principles to help businesses easily convert traffic to converts and sales. Simplicity The typically complicated nature of cryptocurrency and blockchain is a turn-off for many and has slowed adoption. Therefore, cryptocurrency platforms, especially a crypto platform that offers revolutionary solutions to businesses, investors, and individuals, will have a great edge if it focuses on simplicity. This is not just about simplicity in design but in the overall process of using the platform. New users should not feel overwhelmed when they come across your product else they will leave. Customer is King In planning an onboarding process, use one that is well-tailored to the users needs. You may determine this by using different methods of analytics and also tracking customer actions on your platform. When it comes to cryptocurrency, people really just want to buy and sell the currency. Anything that doesn meaningfully contribute to that is mere garbage. Active Research and Analytics Before you begin planning onboarding at all and, perhaps, wasting your efforts, it is good to spend a great deal of time doing some market research. Determine the kind of environment and market that ensure the growth of your product. Learn about potential customers needs. Find out things your competitors are doing wrong and make those your selling points. Even after kick-off, perform analytics to know which actions lead to the conversions and if a change is necessary. Not knowing that is one of the\\xa0onboarding mistakes to avoid. Show and Tell Onboarding is not just to get users to start utilizing your product; it is to show them how in a simple and non-intrusive manner. Instead of\\xa0too many screen-by-screen walkthroughs\\xa0which are boring and arduous, short video tutorials and animations would be better to effectively explain all you want to. You know how valuable your product is and what it does, but the real question is: do your customers? Educate For a cryptocurrency platform, it is important to build your onboarding around ensuring that new users are quickly acquainted with the services you offer. While you will have many pro new users, consider that a significant chunk of your user base would consist of cryptocurrency newbies. Therefore, build your onboarding around educating them about the functions of your platform. That is the more reason why you have to keep onboarding very simple. Engage with your Users Onboarding should not be a process that is just about the organization alone. The user too should be actively involved. While showing and telling, asking the users to repeat the processes explained would make for a better experience. Form a Forum Communities (including online ones) are very good. You can create a network of people who use your trading platform and give them an avenue to discuss, seek help, and banter. Online forums give people a sense of belonging and makes users more likely to stay on as lifetime customers. Personalize it If there were a perfect onboarding process, it still wouldn sit well with every single user of your product. As a result of that, it is important to make the experience unique and personal for each person. That doesn mean creating a different onboarding process (really?) It means ensuring that the process leaves some impact on the user. You surely know what they say about first impressions. Make sure you know your customers. Top executives like\\xa0Matt Sornson recognize\\xa0the importance of making onboarding personalized. Request Feedback And yes, it still works. But as mentioned earlier, keep things simple and short. Don make your customers start feeling they are sitting for an examination when you give them a lengthy list of questions. You may trigger them to rate your product and leave a review but be sure it is also in a non-intrusive manner. Selling Points Structure your selling point about how trading with you would help the customer. No one really wants to know what your software can do if its features won eventually be of help to them. This tweet by Jason Fried of Basecamp years ago sums it up: Conclusion Many make the mistake that onboarding ends when a user signs up for a paid subscription of your product. That is somewhat true, but ignoring everything after that is a disaster. Even after signing up, onboarding still continues and you owe them good treatment. Customer is king, right?',\n",
       "  'Starting from June I in charge of marketing at Squilla Capital, and we have two exciting releases hitting the market in September this year. Hence, I had to compile a marketing strategy. As you probably know, there are a lot of types of advertisements that are running in different mediums or channels. Some of them are designed for brand awareness, some of them are designed to drive traffic on your website and others for driving more sales. But which medium and channel should you choose when you have a business in the cryptocurrency field, for example? Is it ok to use Google Services? Is it ok to use Social Media Ads? To figure it out, I went ahead and analyzed a competitor traffic data. As you can see, ad networks have a strong presence there, however, dogeclick and crypto.ad are basically  service paying people to visit websites. They are good to boost metrics, but traffic quality is low, resulting in low conversion rates. Coingecko has a very convenient self-service ad manager on their website, while you have to talk to a manager to be advertised on\\xa0CMC. But what if you need to launch a diversified campaign focused on crypto people right now and without problems dealing with multiple platforms? Ad networks like\\xa0Coinzilla has a lot of benefits. There are over 500 major crypto websites online at this moment, which serves at least 154 million people (that the number of unique BTC addresses). There are no doubts that every user that owns a crypto wallet address, is active on at least 1 crypto related website. You probably know how important is to be able to start an advertising campaign fast. Even if we are talking about a discount, an early bird or maybe there is a launch of a new product scheduled, if the campaign cannot be started when is needed, the results will be under your expectations. As you probably know, for some time now, the cryptocurrency advertisements have been banned or limited in the most advertising networks. By using a niche advertising network, you have the certitude that your ad will be approved fast, and your campaign will not suffer delays. * Recommendation: Before starting to work with an advertising network, check if they offer live support for your campaigns. By using a crypto advertising network, you forget about banner designing services. Most of the networks offer this service for free. The full banner set will be designed by experienced web design specialized teams, so you can be sure that you get out the most of your banners. By using a crypto advertising network, you have great traffic quality. Your ads will be promoted only by cryptocurrency websites after some certain requirements are met. So, you can forget about paying high CPMs for low-quality websites a niche advertising network, they simply don exist. You can enjoy the same qualitative services and customer interface experience as with other big networks. Basically, you have the full control over your ads, so you can do any change you want in real time, so the optimization process is fast and This is a big plus. Niched advertising networks are offering live support for advertising campaign development. In fact, every advertiser has a dedicated account manager ready to solve every problem that could appear, 24/7. By discussing with your account manager, you find multiple advertising methods, such as native banners, standard IAB banners and press releases distributed on the top websites from the industry. Written properly, the press releases have unimaginable power. You can convince your buyers that nobody is better than you out there, only with a few lines. And the good part? will stay there forever. If you choose to work with a crypto niched advertising network, you have the option to pay with Bitcoin, Ethereum or, if it needed, other cryptocurrencies. The payments are secured and anonymous. Niched advertising networks have bigger conversion rates, simply because the banners are placed only on niche websites. The CTR for the biggest advertising networks, for display campaigns, is around 0.10%. You might say that is ok, but in fact, is not that good! In the same time by using a niche advertising network you will get higher CTR (around 0.15% A higher CTR means that you can get more conversions in the same budget. The advertising campaigns on niched networks are possibly the most cost-efficient part of a marketing strategy. You can see the results in real time, and the return of investment is almost guaranteed in every situation. If you are a crypto business developer, we suggest you think twice before making the decision to invest in marketing offered by a general advertising network.',\n",
       "  'On July 8, the Information Commissioner Office (ICO) announced the highest GDPR fine ever of  million over last year data breach at British Airways. The UK data watchdog elected to fine the airline as its  security arrangements led to the breach of credit card information, names, addresses, travel booking details, and logins of around 500,000 customers.\\xa0 In recent years, consumers have become wearily accustomed to data breaches of this magnitude. GDPR allows a company to be fined a maximum of 4% of its worldwide turnover; British Airways fine amounts to 1.5% of its 2017 revenue. With this fine, the ICO wants to send out a signal to companies that they should care about their customer privacy. From 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) will introduce similar data privacy rights for residents of the sunshine state. In the EU, meanwhile, the following types of data fall under the auspices of GDPR: This is just a small list of potential data points that GDPR covers. You might think that personal data only includes name, address, and phone number. In fact, under the GDPR act, anything that helps to identify a person is considered to be personal information, including theirs physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity. In my opinion, GDPR is doing a good thing within Europe. However, our data is still in the hands of companies that can decide to use it correctly or abuse it. Therefore, I believe that blockchain fits well for this use case, especially for storing data permissions on-chain. The concept of on-chain data permissions is also known as  data, which forms part of the Web 3.0 vision. This school of thought holds that businesses should be able to harness user data  provided the end user is compensated and/or has consented to it. Data ethics also obliges businesses to create data-sharing frameworks that adhere to data storage laws such as GDPR, where applicable. Datawallet is a project focused on storing data in an ethical way using blockchain technology. I asked its CEO Serafin Lion Engel to expand on the need for  data to construct Web 3.0.  is the critical first step to the realization of Web 3.0. The vision of creating a decentralized internet, where every application runs locally on a person own device, hinges critically on our ability to first locally source and store our data in order to fuel these applications, he explained.  the safest and most seamless way to gather the data you create on the internet, cryptographically store it on your own device, and through Datawallet personal API, share it with any application you like. Datawallet 3.0 is the cornerstone of Web 3. Let further explore how Datawallet enables Web 3.0. Datawallet is a digital wallet for your online data. It grants consumers a simple, private and meaningful way to control their data, thereby shifting responsibility for data storage from web companies to consumers. From the perspective of businesses, the advantage of integrating a solution like Datawallet is that it ensures regulatory compliance while building trusted relationships with consumers. Developers are also incentivized to create products that utilize Datawallet, whose private-public key pair will be familiar to blockchain devs. An infinite number of additional keys can be created, each controlling the data for a particular product or service. Permission flow is controlled via the Datawallet SDK, while a GUI speeds up app creation. Datawallet allows fine-grained permissioning over its data, stored on-chain. Also, every permissioning change is stored in an easily auditable blockchain record.\\xa0 Datawallet aims to fix the broken data ecosystem and bring trust and transparency over data usage. Key Benefits After analyzing their whitepaper, I have gleaned the following key points about Datawallet: Datawallet aims to power an array of Web 3.0 apps that utilize ethical, cross-platform data. In doing so, it will pave the way for subsequent Web 3.0 products and integrations, formed around a framework in which all permission data is immutably stored on-chain. Source Component The sourcing tool is a key element for the Datawallet ecosystem. It enables users to  (import) their online data into their personal Datawallet. Crucially, no data flows through APIs. All data is processed and stored locally. Store Component Next, the locally sourced data is encrypted on the user device and stored. The encryption key is derived from an integrated Ethereum wallet. The resulting solution ensures that once a user sources their data into their Datawallet, neither Datawallet nor any other organization can access the data without the user active initiation.\\xa0 Use Component In order to enable access to the data when it is requested, a  component provides this access request. Datawallet on-chain permissioning system allows users to decrypt and share their data with apps and brands they trust. The user has full control over who can use their data, when they can use it and how.\\xa0 When Datawallet encounters a whitelisted app, it retrieves the requested data points from the app smart contract on the blockchain to present to the user. If the user agrees to give this app access to the specified data points, Datawallet will sign and publish this as a transaction on the blockchain. At the same time, it will release the decrypted data.  Datawallet has built a showcase app called `YouAreTheProduct.wtf`. This application tracks everything possible about you to build a data profile. As Facebook is still seen as a rather untrustworthy social media giant, the data is sourced from Facebook into your Datawallet. After some time, Datawallet can show you your Facebook Ad profile. Also, see what Facebook thinks your  interests are, find out which companies directly target you through Facebook ads and see a list of every ad you ever interacted with through FB. The goal of this showcase app is to make you aware about the fact that Facebook knows a lot about you and (ab)uses this information to directly target you with the most relevant ads. In short, you are the product! The Blockstack team overarching goal is to give users control of their data and identity. They accomplishing that goal by providing a suite of developer tools and protocols intended to lower the start-up barriers of dApp development. One of the project first features, Blockstack Authentication, connects your identity to all of the dApps in the Blockstack ecosystem. It utilizes single sign-on with your universal username, and in place of passwords, public-key cryptography that runs on your local device software. Authentication is entirely on-chain, maintained by the Blockstack blockchain and Blockstack Naming System. At last, Blockstack uses Gaia data storage. Gaia is a user-controlled storage system that enables applications to interact with private data lockers. Goal: Blockstack ID provides user-controlled login and storage that enable you to take back control of your identity and data. Datum is not a direct competitor but also focuses on safe data storage. Users can pay a small fee for having their data stored in the Datum Network. The data is stored encrypted and anonymized. Once the data is stored, users can decide if and with whom they want to share this data.\\xa0 Also, users can sell their data to reputable businesses in return for DAT tokens.\\xa0 Goal: Provide an easy to use solution for storing data securely and managing who can access the data. Besides, the Datum SDK allows developers to create applications that securely store data. This year, PikcioChain released its PikcioBrowser which aims to transform internet search. The browser helps users to protect their identity (and data) while browsing the web. The browser does not store any meaningful data like cookies or search history, nor disclose any information to third-parties.\\xa0 Goal: Protect user data while browsing via peer-to-peer technology, without sharing any personal information. The current internet needs better data control for users, who are currently paying for access with their identity. This is a recipe for disaster and is simply unsustainable given the prohibitive costs of data loss to end users and enterprises alike. Solutions such as Datawallet and Blockstack will be integral in ensuring the success of the emerging Web 3.0, as well as bolstering the privacy of Web 2.0 services that elect to integrate self-sovereign data solutions.  Personally, I believe we will see more adoption of data security tools out of necessity, both on the current web and on the decentralized model that is now being constructed. Convincing large companies to implement Datawallet will be tough, but that task should get easier with every large scale data breach, demonstrating the need for tougher data storage standards. Full disclosure: I do not own Datawallet, Datum, or Pikcio tokens and I have not participated in any of these ICOs. This article is not intended as investment advice. The article is written in cooperation with Datawallet. All information comes from my own research ',\n",
       "  'According to Dr. John Henry Clippinger, Research Scientist at MIT Media Lab, City Sciences Group and co-founder of Token Commons Foundation, the world is transitioning towards blockchain and smart contracts for managing its carbon emissions. While speaking with HackerNoon, Clippinger noted how candidates in the first Democratic debate this year discussed negative carbon and the need to capture carbon across economic sectors. Democratic presidential candidates Joe Biden and John Delaney are calling for net-zero carbon emissions for 2050.  time for carbon capture is now, he said, noting how blockchain could be a technology to help society avert climate catastrophe. Clippinger, who is a researcher in artificial intelligence, an author and currently works at MIT Media Lab, says the problems with implementing policy is that only particular sovereign jurisdictions can enforce them. Today, Cap and Trade systems are usually self-attesting and self-reporting. On a blockchain system, renewable credits can be more closely tracked.  you have algorithm-based contracts, they can be independently audited, he said.  a particular solar installation generates so much sustainable energy at a certain time of day. There\\'s a smart contract that analyzes that data, and then on the basis of that data signs a certain credential and maybe some kind of credit for that. That data then gets recorded in the blockchain. These are things that can be automated, according to Clippinger.  you\\'re able to have basically a very transparent and tamper-proof way of saying whether it\\'s compliant or not. The contract itself can be a self-contained algorithm that can be independently verified. When you\\'re doing anything to scale and you\\'ve got hundreds of billions and trillions of IoT devices out there,you\\'re going to have to do something like that. Such a system could be necessary to achieve the  Nation\\'s vision of planetary climate neutrality which means net-zero carbon dioxide emissions by balancing carbon emissions with carbon removal.  problem is we have to take carbon out of the atmosphere, says Clippinger.   we need to build living systems rather than extractive systems. To be able to get people and companies and institutions to start to transition from extractive to regenerative practices is a very important point. It is the only way that we\\'re really going to deal with climate change in a really viable and sustainable way. Human society is totally out of balance with nature, Clippinger says.  is reflected in the collapse of ecosystems everywhere and climate instability. So, the whole point of having an independent ledger that we can trust, and with which you can record actions and implementations that affect that restoration of balance [while being] independently verified is absolutely critical going forward. That\\'s one of the great appeals of the blockchain. Clippinger rhetorically asks while we talk:  we getting into an [environmental] deficit? Are we really putting carbon back into the atmosphere? Are we creating imbalances in our ecosystems? How do we adjust our behavior? This is the kind of thinking we are going to have to adopt at the global scale. Clippinger, who has worked at MIT Media Lab for about twelve years (and spent twelve years at Harvard before that) has always been interested in technology as a way of implementing policy and change.  who is familiar with biological systems knows that we\\'re really past an inflection point, says.  U.N. document forecasts the extinction of millions of species. We are headed in a very precipitous way and there\\'s no doubt about it. The data keeps getting stronger and more unequivocal. Clippinger co-founded  which uses the blockchain to bring together data, networks, and incentives for the world to finally adopt renewable energy at scale. Three years ago, he helped found the Token Commons Foundation, based out of Zug Switzerland, whose Mission Statement begins with the goal, \"To build a more sustainable and equitable future through the creation of a commons-based blockchain protocol\" The TCF protocol implemented a commons governance structure that enables autonomy and self-determination while encouraging cooperation and inclusion. TCF Protocol used Swytch as aunit of account for verification of sustainable energy. One project that Clippinger mentions is  Network a global marketplace and contracting platform for Earth\\'s ecosystem assets, services, and data. The Massachusetts-based company is developing the digital infrastructure for Earth\\'s balance sheet to streamline carbon-sequestering solutions. Regen Network protocol and token (XRN) allow teams to build an information technology infrastructure to account for ecological value. The idea behind Regen Network is to enable coordinated, transparent action to increase ecosystem health for the benefit of all stakeholders. Regen Ledger is designed to be a cost accounting machine, an ecological data marketplace, a distributed computational network, and a biospheric monitoring device. Clippinger discussed how Regen Network is leveraging blockchain technology to create incentives for shifting to regenerative agriculture and land management, and to address systemic problems by developing a system to incentivize, reward, track and verify ecological impact from regenerative agriculture and regenerative systems  as well as to capture carbon to keep it out of the atmosphere. The Proof-of-Stake Regen Network is building on the  Network SDK. One of its current pilot projects, with the Rainforest Foundation, connects donors directly with indigenous communities on the frontlines of rainforest protection by monitoring ecological contracts made with local communities in the Amazon. The smart contract defines the project, including who is involved, what is being measured, what will be verified, which rewards are linked to verified changes, and which data is written to the blockchain. Once a contract has been signed, participants use the Regen Network to track progress. The blockchain enables a holistic approach to avert climate catastrophe. The blockchain and distributed ledger technology can fundamentally transform everything about how the world monitors and manages its carbon footprint.  do need such a ledger, says Clippinger.  do need to create incentives to [avert climate disaster]. Clippinger believes blockchain can help people better manage resources.  is coming, he says.  people associate crypto with bitcoin and the whole crypto-anarchist movement, but cryptocurrency and blockchain are far bigger than that. The whole concept of programmable money and currency is something that\\'s been in the works independent of that whole bitcoin world. He adds:  you\\'re seeing that now with major players going in and creating stable coins or all-new kinds of infrastructure. You\\'ve got JP Morgan going in and creating their own stablecoin, their own currency. You\\'ve got Fidelity going in with digital assets. You got now the big announcement out of Facebook where they want to own this space with Libra. This is all going big-time mainstream. How it gets designed is going to be a big shakeout.',\n",
       "  'There is an air of gloom and doom in the cryptocurrency markets this week. Across the board, bitcoin and the leading altcoins are all showing a drop in price. The question for crypto owners is: what should I do now? Reza Jafery\\xa0posting on Medium talks about the need to make sane decisions when the market is in this state, saying,  or investing in cryptocurrency is a psychological war against yourself. Indeed, investing in markets does require mental strength and self-control. Jafery also comments that if the traditional markets require traders and investors to stay strong, then the crypto market requires\\xa0 mental fortitude of a Jedi. This is because it is the most volatile market in existence and it is as he says,  completely sentiment driven. As a result, the market movements don always make sense. It also has more retail investors than any other market. These investors aren professionals and they tend to be driven more by the feeling of excitement about the market. For example, when there is a surge in Google searches for  the price is typically on the rise, as the search volume actually starts to pick up just before the price goes up. Therefore the price is being driven by emotion. And as Jafery says,  come out on top in a market-driven by emotion, you have to remove emotion from your trading. When the price falls, it is hard to stay calm, but that is exactly what you should do because you can be confident that it will go back up again. Another mistake that investors tend to make is trying to  the bottom. This means you attempting to enter into a trade at the bottom of a downtrend. It almost impossible to execute this successfully. As Jafery suggests,\\xa0 you planning on entering a trade, it better to just get in near the bottom rather than wait.\\xa0This advice is particularly important for retail investors. Another sensible bit of advice is this: don sell coins that are falling for ones that are going up. If you done this, you certainly not alone. What tends to happen is that the minute you sell those coins that don seem to be performing, and probably at a loss, hoping to make a killing with some coin that is surging in price, you can bet that the coins you just sold will skyrocket. Finally, don keep looking at the price charts. They won miraculously start shooting upwards because you watching them. Jafery recalls what happened to him when he sat  for hours on end:  I wasn being productive, I was needlessly monitoring my holdings like a hawk. It made me more emotional, and it made me overtrade. Two things I now know to avoid at all cost. Stay calm folks and make sane decisions with your crypto holdings this week!',\n",
       "  'According to various journalists and analysts, Bitcoin is dead  and it\\xa0died more than 350 times. (In that list, you also find a number of obituaries for blockchain and crypto.) With these articles coming every year since 2010, perhaps the analysts are a bit off. While the debate about the merits of cryptocurrency and whether blockchain is a\\xa0fad\\xa0among some industries continues, we took a look at US Indeed data to see whether tech talent is still interested in the field  and whether employers are still hiring. So with searches for crypto, blockchain and Bitcoin jobs down 67% from 2018 to 2019, has the job market for blockchain and crypto actually started to go by the wayside? According to our data, the crypto and blockchain market is far from dead  in fact, it still rapidly growing. From February 2018 to February 2019, we saw the share of US job postings related to crypto, blockchain and Bitcoin grow\\xa090%. So why has job seeker interest slid so far from February 2018 to February 2019? Well Trend of bitcoin price (January 2013 to May 2019). [source] Not only did bitcoin reach an all-time high in December 2017, in February 2019 it had 37% of the value it did compared to the year before. Job seekers responded to the peak in bitcoin pricing with searches for roles related to Bitcoin, crypto and blockchain: So while job seeker interest dipped quite a bit since last year as bitcoin price slid, the share of searches related to crypto and blockchain is still up 553%\\xa0from 2016 to 2019. While there have been dips in the share of job postings, crypto and blockchain roles have steadily increased since 2016. Though Bitcoin launched in 2009, companies only started to seriously look at implementing blockchain beyond currency a few years later. We see the share of employer interest go up in mid-to-late 2016, shortly after IBM announced its  Garage, setting itself up for the Blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) market. In fact, the share of job postings for blockchain and crypto is up 4,086% from 2016 to 2019. That in no small part due to the banking industry investing in blockchain because it brings down costs while increasing transparency as well as speed and safety in storing and transmitting data. As of\\xa0late 2018, three-quarters of banks\\xa0were either adopting or looking into blockchain. For the first time, the number of jobs per million exceeded the number of searches per million. It could be reasonable to assume that if bitcoin drops dramatically again, a candidate looking for a blockchain role would run into less competition than they would after a large increase. There also\\xa0does appear to be a skills shortage\\xa0as enterprise projects have matured over the last three years. With employer interest near its peak, we examined which US employers have the largest amount of listings related to Bitcoin, crypto and blockchain. Banks might stand to benefit the most from blockchain, but only one lands in our top ten: JPMorgan Chase (JPM). Earlier this month, Microsoft made JPM Quorum blockchain (its enterprise version of Ethereum launched four years ago) the\\xa0first distributed ledger platform through the Azure Blockchain Service. Microsoft lands eighth on the list right behind JPM. Filling out the list are two more tech giants (IBM and Cisco) and six consulting firms, including three of the Big Four Accounting Firms. Ten on the list is the only dedicated blockchain company, Consensys. These rankings suggest that though banking is heavily investing in blockchain, consulting firms so far have the highest concentration of opportunities for those in the industry. Next, we looked at what metros had the highest share of job postings in crypto and blockchain:  This list is close to the\\xa0largest tech hubs of 2019\\xa0(metros where tech jobs have the largest share of postings) but has a few notable differences. New York, for example, isn considered a  hub though it has a lot of tech jobs  it simply has a lot of jobs. However, it places third in blockchain/crypto jobs, playing host to a number of consulting firms, and, of course, Wall Street. Chicago and Denver also have a large share of jobs that are in blockchain or crypto but aren  hubs either. On the flipside, while Baltimore and Raleigh\\xa0are\\xa0 hubs, they don place in the top ten for blockchain/crypto roles. All that to say, if you looking to make a move to a new role and a new home, make sure you not just going to a metro with  tech roles, but one with the right roles for you. Investing in bitcoin right now may or may not pay off, but it a great time to jump into a blockchain career as the overall industry trends in the right direction. Job seekers might be fickle in their interest, but employers, from consultants to banking to government, are still full steam ahead in hiring those ready for the opportunity. Methodology: Indeed analyzed the percentage change in share of job postings and share of job searches per million for roles related to bitcoin, cryptocurrency and blockchain during the time period specified. Companies and metro areas listed had the highest share of job postings related to bitcoin, cryptocurrency and blockchain on Indeed from February 2018 to February 2019.',\n",
       "  ' Tech are coming for our banks, but should we be worried? Digital currencies are back in the spotlight as US regulators take swing at Facebook lofty plans. Last week David Marcus, head of Facebooks  project and former president of Paypal testified before the US government for their proposed digital currency  which according to David Marcus, is intended to address an important problem:  a daughter who wants to send money home to her mum in another country. Of the $200 she sends, $14 on average will be lost because of fees. It can also take several days or even weeks for the mother to receive the money. A delay that can prove disastrous in an emergency. Not to mention lines may be long, and collection points may be in high crime areas. Captured in a small village close to Tangier, Morocco: People line up to use the only ATM in town. Libra will be a stable currency that can be used for payments and other financial activities around the world. One big advantage is that payments in Libra will be available on both existing payment rails (i.e. card terminals), and also by scanning barcodes via your smart phone. The currency will be maintained by a distributed ledger, empowering users to take custody of their own funds, initially in the Calibra wallet online. This means your smartphone can become your bank account, killing the need for a retail bank entirely. Today 1.7 billion adults in the world remain unbanked, with women making up a higher percentage of those than men. Indeed many countries around the world have poor access to financial services that involve long lines at ATMs & Banks, limited access to credit, high borrowing rates and more. Libra aims to lower the barriers of entry to financial services by requiring only a smartphone, and reducing the costs of commerce with distributed ledger technology. With access to 2.38 Billion monthly active Facebook users, its easy to see how Libra could be integrated into the everyday lives of so many people. Before Facebook announcement, banks and governments weren threatened by digital currencies. Many of the projects that exist today simply aren as equipped to take on the world. But Facebook is a centralised company, and must cooperate with local authorities in each jurisdiction (unlike Bitcoin). This is one reason why Facebook was careful to keep separate the Libra foundation from its US counterpart. Facebook also has a terrible reputation, with authorities around the world unhappy with the size and power they already have. Not to mention their track record of scandals that have rigged democratic processes and proliferated the spread of  news Despite its challenges, Libra, if successful could be a popular option for those who suffer from poor local banking experiences and an inflationarylocal currency. Certain governments will increasingly see Libra as a threat to both Central Bank policy and retail banking industries and so it likely that central banks with the most to lose from Libra will be the first ones to oppose the use of it in their countries. One of the major themes of the recent US government hearings has been Money Laundering and the perceived risks associated with digital currencies. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin expressed his concernsthat Libra could be used by terrorists and money launderers, a narrative often used to argue against the merits of Bitcoin and other digital assets. While these concerns are valid, he added that regulators are open to digital currencies so long as these risks are managed, and that Libra has a long way to go to prove this. But as far as digital currencies go, how concerned should we really be about money laundering and terrorist financing? Should they be treated any differently to cash? One interesting statistic shared by Steven Mnuchin in his recent cryptocurrency press conference discussed the progress that has been made in combating anti-money laundering & terrorism with the Banking Secrecy Act: In a recent interview, Caitlin Long, a corporate finance expert and long standing advocate for digital currencies cited her 2018 piece on the cost of the Banking Secrecy Act, stating the most recent publicly available data for these figures is from 2006, in which it was reported that 16 million BSA reports had been collected, resulting in a total of 296 anti-money laundering convictions. Her interpretation being that BSA reports had increased from 16 million (2006) to 20 million per year (2018, as per Mnuchin recent statement) which isn a significant difference. The conclusion of her 2006 analysis was that 296 convictions is a small outcome for the extra costs and efforts that went into collecting 16 million BSA reports. In other words, decades of costly fees for consumers, sensitive data breaches, and non-existent innovation in financial services may be getting traded in for a sobering number of yearly convictions. While anti-money laundering and terrorist financing are important, it shouldn be so taboo to ask fair questions about how we can balance this with improvements in the user experience of money, especially if these risks are overblown. Networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum are open and permissionless, which means anyone with a computer and internet connection can contribute to the network by running a  or adding proposals to it open source development. This is a core design feature that promotes egalitarian access whilst also giving the network resistance to censorship and control. The recenthearings have made it clear that Libra will not benefit from these properties and will in turn prioritise the needs of the corporations and regulators involved rather than its users. Some points we can confirm from the hearings are: Still, Libra has impressive technical details shared in its white paper and technical papers. Its network will have its own programming language called  that will allow invited members to build applications and extend the use cases of Libra. It likely that Facebook will encourage third parties to build new financial services on top of Libra, including tools for lending and saving, all without the need for a bank. Countries that are weighed down by the limitations of cash, bad central bank policy, and poor retail banking experiences have the most to gain from Libra. Ironically, these countries are also the most likely to ban Libra as it directly reduces the influence and control they have over their own banking systems. Anti-money laundering practices are a major bottle neck for global commerce. If Facebook gets this right it could significantly reduce the costs of financial services which would in turn create more equal opportunities for the un-banked and under-banked. It could also promote competition among retail banking in first world economies. Libra will not be open and permissionless. If Libra becomes mainstream it will be interesting to see if these limitations cause users to migrate to more open networks. _________________________________________________________________ I collect my information from a variety of sources linked throughout the article.

       "  'Corindex July 2019 crypto report is comprised of parsed data on key cryptocurrency exchanges. Indicators, specifically designed by this crypto analytic platform, are calculated past the analysis of the blockchain network of various crypto assets. To best approximate the overall state of the cryptocurrency market, the report shows data only on the top cryptocurrencies with the largest capitalizations, and, occasionally, currencies that showed biggest relative changes by one indicator or another over the analyzed period. The report contains nine chapters, each of which encompasses the changes to its designated indicator over the analyzed period. The first chapter of the Corindex crypto report is dedicated to the currency transaction volume of various cryptocurrencies, one of the most important market indicators, expressed in United States dollars.  As always, Bitcoin stands on the entirely different plane from other cryptocurrencies, sporting a monstrous volume equivalent to 653 170 485 253,00 USD - 56.18% more than it previous monthly volume. Bitcoin Cash is second. Leagues behind Bitcoin but well ahead of its competition with a monthly transaction volume of 59 664 284 450,00 USD, which is 19.21% less than the volume of the Bitcoin Cash in June. Ethereum takes up the next place; its monthly volume has dropped by -9.87% down to 19 376 925 910,00 USD. Litecoin is ranked fourth. A monthly decrease of almost exactly 36% has brought its monthly volume to the 13 278 274 366,00 USD.\\xa0 Dogecoin is the only other top-5 coin aside from BTC that sports an increase in volume during July, and a hefty one at that. Due to an increase of 42.64%, its monthly volume has reached 4 188 530 511,00 USD.The second chapter of this crypto report covers the number of cryptocurrency transactions conducted on cryptocurrency blockchains over the last 7 and 30 day periods. According to it, the blockchain of Ripple has endured the largest number of transactions - 31 486 672,00, which is 15.89% more than last month. Ethereum is second despite a -14.2% negative growth, with 23 161 971,00 transactions. The blockchain of Bitcoin has verified -3.72% fewer transactions than during previous analyzed period, placing it third with 10.43kk monthly transactions. The number of Bitcoin Cash transactions, on the other hand, grew by 10.06% to 1 624 083,00, placing it fourth. Despite a slight decrease of -4.47%, Ethereum Classic ranks fifth with the 1 265 272,00 ETC transactions during the last 30 days. Litecoin takes up the next place with 933 933,00 transactions and a -5.36% decrease over the month. Dogecoin experienced a similar decrease of -5.99%, which brought its transaction number down to 860 418. Third chapter of this crypto research deals with the average currency transaction size expressed in USD and is a derivative of the indicators covered in the two previous chapters. The Average Currency Transaction in USD is calculated as (Sum of transactions in USD) divided by (Amount of Currency transactions) of the respective crypto asset. Unsurprisingly, Bitcoin is leading here as well. Having increased by 234.03% over the last thirty days, its monthly transaction size now amounts to 197 566,00 USD in equivalent. It worth noting that BTC is the only cryptocurrency that has seen growth in this category over the analyzed period. Litecoin average transaction size has decreased by -44.04% over the month and is now 9 722,00 USD. Despite the huge drop, it still takes up the second place. Sporting an even larger decrease of almost 90%, Bitcoin Cash is ranked third nonetheless with an average transaction volume of 9 224,00 USD. Having dropped by -30.72% down to 2 156,00 USD average currency transaction volume, Reddcoin is fourth. Due to a negative growth of -73.62%, Dogecoin average transaction size is now 1 091,00 USD in equivalent, which still allows it to wrap up these top-5 currencies with the largest average transaction sizes. Only a fraction of all cryptocurrency transactions involve United States dollar or other fiat currencies; most of them are conducted between various crypto assets. The eighth chapter of this report examines the Share of Direct Currency/USD Transactions which allows one to examine just how tied a particular crypto asset is to USD. With the recent positive trend, Bitcoin only strengthened its position as a gateway between crypto and fiat worlds: For every 100$ in Bitcoin transactions, 98.29 are direct BTC/USD exchanges, which is 36.64% more than during the previous month. Following the same train of thought, for every 100$ in BCH transactions, only 0,65862714 USD correlates to the actual BCH/USD transactions, which is \\t-96.95% less than during June. The rest of the currencies follow suit. Due to a drop of -80.97%, only 0,56569244% of all Ethereum transactions involve USD. Likewise, Litecoin share has dropped by -85.88% and is now only 0,40390932 USD for every 100 USD in LTC transactions. Similarly, having dropped by -88.63%, Dogecoin share of Direct Currency/USD Transactions is now only 0,04745681 per 100 USD. Dash is the last currency with any meaningful amount of direct currency/USD transactions: for every 100 USD of Dash monthly transaction volume, 0,01844093 USD belong to DASH/USD exchanges.Disclaimer: the content is for informational purposes only; you should not construe any such information or other material as an investment, financial, or other advice.

       "  'The emergence and growth of blockchain technology and the resultant cryptocurrencies has sent shockwaves throughout the financial markets. Cryptocurrencies have changed the way people conduct financial transactions globally. Be it typical mobile money transfers of the payment of goods and services; blockchain technology has been integrated into pertinent aspects of financial transactions. It is expected that crypto banking will become an integral part of the financial industry due to its impressive uptake. It is a massive improvement to traditional banking setups, which have a centralized system. Since cryptocurrencies are decentralized systems, they not only offer services that you will find in conventional banks, but also guarantee more efficiency, reduced bureaucracy, transparency, and security. Here how cryptocurrencies are revolutionizing the banking industry. Traditional banking was seen as a convenient way of making financial transactions. Nonetheless, advances in technology have left banks vulnerable to data breaches and other governance & compliance issues. Cryptocurrencies are playing an integral role in addressing these imperfections. For instance, crypto banks are more immune to data hacks compared to traditional banks. Similarly, cryptocurrency transactions are anonymous and secure. If someone makes a payment to you using paper cash, there a possibility that the money could be counterfeit. This isn the case with crypto-cash since you cannot counterfeit a cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrencies are primarily based on a decentralized system in the sense that blockchains allow you to make transactions securely and independently without involving intermediaries. This isn the case in the traditional banking system where the money is stored in the bank, and users can only make transactions that are sanctioned by the banks. In the crypto world, no entity holds onto your money. Instead, your money is held on the cloud via the blockchain technology. This explains why there have been fears that the traditional banking system could collapse altogether if more people shifted to crypto banks. Cryptocurrencies are more evolutionary compared to fiat currencies which typically operate in the traditional banking system. The use of blockchain technology has made crypto-cash more fluid besides enabling users to make quick and convenient transactions from wherever they are. Cryptocurrency transactions are generally cheaper than traditional money transfers. If you are to pay a vendor $2,500 using your credit card, for instance, there will be additional charges along the way. This results from the fact that there are other entities involved in the fulfillment of that transaction. As a result, you will end up with less money than you are owed for merely offering your clients the convenience of making credit card payments. One of the most outstanding features about crypto cash is that you are not required to pay high charges for transactions to be processed. Often crypto-cash transactions are either free or incredibly low. Banks do not issue cryptocurrencies. Instead, users acquire them through mining, which involves complex algorithmic processes. Often, there is an unbounded supply built onto the code of cryptocurrencies. In contrast, traditional currencies have a limited supply chain. The availability of fiat currencies can change anytime depending on the fiscal policies of governments that issue them. You can put a figure on cryptocurrencies. For instance, you cannot claim to have more than 50 million Bitcoin. Therefore, the finite nature of cryptocurrencies will increase demand, thus driving up value. It is expected that over time, it will become increasingly difficult to mine crypto-cash until the upper limit is attained. The finite supply of cryptocurrencies makes them inherently deflationary. As technology improves, users expect financial transactions to be faster, free, and easier. One of the changes that cryptocurrencies will undoubtedly bring to the banking industry is convenience. You won need to carry that chunky wallet with wads of cash and credit cards in it. The clanky nature of the fiat currency system means you have to do a lot to keep track of your transactions and bank balances. Cryptocurrencies offer users a credible store of value without subjecting them to the inconvenience of walking around with cash or credit cards, which are prone to theft, loss, and similar incidents. Blockchain technology is the embodiment of the rapid digitalization that characterizes today banking industry. Blockchain technology provides the option of storing your currency in electronic wallets, which are safeguarded using secure passwords. While it still possible for a user to lose his/her crypto cash, it would require a lot of silly mistakes for that to happen. The traditional banking system is skewed and is designed to act to favor those who have money and sound financial knowledge. This is why we still have people who prefer storing hard cash at home rather than banking it. Due to inflation and similar fiscal phenomena, fiat currencies always seem to lose their value every year. With cryptocurrencies, your money stays secure since banks or government agencies cannot devalue it. Once cryptocurrencies attain widespread acceptance in the financial markets, they will help people with minimal financial knowledge to make sound investments without worrying about devaluation. Similarly, such individuals will be in control of their finances without involving intermediaries. It is pretty clear that cryptocurrencies are changing the banking industry because they have new and exciting benefits to users compared to the fiat currency system. In as much as blockchain technology is still in its experimental stage, it is exciting to think about how it will revolutionize the banking system in the near future. It doesn come as a surprise that financial institutions are increasingly incorporating blockchain technology into their operations. Businesses across different industries are also decentralizing their processes to save costs and attain profitability. This is the essence of blockchain technology. Therefore, inevitably, traditional banks will also follow suit and decentralize their operations in the face of cutthroat competition from cryptocurrencies.',\n",
       "  'If you been in the cryptocurrency and blockchain community for a while, then you surely heard the phrase  just need a killer app to get crypto into the mainstream. Now, as you most likely also noticed, many of the current decentralized applications that are out there have great ideas backing them even revolutionary ones why aren any of these dApps achieving widespread use? Why aren they, or one of them, the  app that we need? I certainly don think the gambling dApps topping the daily usage tracking charts would constitute such an app. The answer to why none of the current dApps represent the  whale of killer apps isn complex, nor is it especially intriguing. It actually quite simple. Most everyday users just don understand how the dApps work, or they feel as if there too great a barrier to use the product.\\xa0 Let look at an example. Say Alice wants to play a game built on Ethereum; before she even grazes the first level, she have to set up a web 3 application such as MetaMask, writing down a mnemonic phrase to set up a wallet. After this lengthy exercise, she might also even need to acquire ETH in order to interact with the platform smart contracts. If I was Alice and completely new to crypto and its benefits, I probably play just about any other game. This is obviously an issue, so how do we solve it? The solution of improving UI/UX is the typical suggestion, and in my personal opinion, it silly. Of course improving UI/UX would help, however, how can we improve upon the most basic functions which blockchain requires? Without requiring the user to set up a private key, or requiring them to interact with a pre-existing key, platforms would not be dApps. They would be centralized, with databases storing passwords, and they would be no different to any other traditional platform.\\xa0 The dApp debate is often centered around UI/UX when in reality the debaters themselves don even use the dApps they discussing; we all hypocrites. Yes, we need to make UI/UX as good as possible, and yes, we also need to use the dApps we so zealously championing for the debate should really be centered around driving both marketing and education to create use instead of rehashing the  UI/UX and users will come argument. We need the public to realize the benefits of blockchain and why they should chose the decentralized option over the traditional one, even if it costs them a few more cents in transaction fees and a few more minutes of their time. We need to educate about the value of personal information and data oil of the digital age we also need to create platforms which provide genuine value to everyday users. The good part of it all is that if we educate and successfully get users to create a private key for their first dApp, then they already bypassed the most difficult barrier to entry to the entire ecosystem, and they can use that key for all future dApps without necessarily requiring a new one. As a side-note, it not uncommon to see games being mocked for not creating  value with blockchain, however, isn entertainment value a great way to educate and draw in users?  We should not discount games ability to be a killer app, in fact, it could very well be a game that achieves  adoption. Gamers, although a broad term, are generally speaking amongst the first adopters of technology. As established, dApps have a barrier of entry problem. The problem with a higher barrier of entry, both one of knowledge and potentially price, is that traditional platforms will almost always beat the dApps; in speed, costs, and knowledge required to get started. The masses trend towards that which is easiest and cheapest, regardless of  costs taxed from their data, and ultimately freedom if we let the privacy threats get out of hand. This is why we, the cryptocurrency community at large, need to be superior in every category where we can be superior. We must create solid alternatives to traditional platforms, and we must do our very best to educate fellow users and citizens of the ongoing threat to privacy and freedom itself.\\xa0 Thankfully, Facebook is being kind enough to assist the crypto space by thoroughly marketing how bad their centralized platform is through their, at this point, countless scandals. Let capitalize on the scandals through education instead of mockery and misery; instead of wallowing about the potentially bleak future, we must instead attempt to prevent a monopolization of privacy through education about decentralization, and bringing power back to the individual. The core fundamentals of blockchain won change, and as such, we shouldn expect  fixing UI/UX to be the solution to all of our problems. In order to facilitate the growth of the sought after  app let allow the builders to create great apps, and let allow the educators and marketers to spread knowledge of blockchain technology. By decreasing the barrier of entry through the spread of knowledge whilst at the same time creating dApps with real and proper value,  the ecosystem of dApps could flourish. The recent Senate Banking Commission hearings have been an example of how, and through which mediums, we can present and educate about blockchain and cryptos as an alternative to centralization and tyranny, which in the case of these hearings was represented by Libra, further explored in another article I wrote recently. To summarize; the  app won suddenly arrive through improving UI/UX. The killer app can only exist in an environment in which blockchain education flourishes. Due to this, we must look away from UI/UX as the sole issue, and instead, our focus must shift towards education as an equal cornerstone in achieving mass adoption for dApps.',\n",

I would recommend you read the first article I wrote on this in 2018 which can be found here.\\r As for Apollon Network\\r \\rApollon Networks mission is to make investing and running your own masternodes, cheap, easy, secure and above all worth your while.\\r  This is done by offering masternode hosting services to the general public. These services simplify the whole set-up, running and monitoring of masternodes.  At the core of the service is the Apollon Network Nodebuilder which can be downloaded from here.\\r Nodebuilder will run on any home computer. An Apollon Network customer will also need to download and fund a desktop wallet with enough collateral to run your desired masternode but once that is done the whole process to start up a masternode is very straight forward.\\r In addition to the software you can download, Apollon Network also offers customers the option to set-up masternodes using the online web portal which can be found here.  Some customers prefer not to load additional software onto their computers and as such the online portal was created to meet this customer demand. The web portal is very similar in operation to the desktop software but because it cannot interact directly with the wallet on your computer the customer will need to copy and paste a few lines of text from the platform into a local configuration file.\\r Currently there are two flavours of service you can avail yourself of at Apollon Network.\\r Firstly, there is RYON.\\r RYON stands for  Your Own Nodes\\r In essence, it allows you to  certain masternodes on a single VPS (virtual private server) which the customer rents independently of Apollon Network.\\r Nodebuilder connects to this VPS via the use of an API key and from there can launch VPS and build multiple masternodes on a single VPS.\\r This is probably one of the cheapest ways of running a masternode available on the market but does require the customer to undertake a few more mouse clicks to get started. \\r I will be writing a new article in a few weeks going into more detail about RYON and how customers can use it to run masternodes.\\r But if you want to dive straight in then, on the Apollon Network website - https://www.apollon.network, you can also find video guides on under the support menu.\\r Secondly\\r You are now able to launch masternodes without renting a VPS yourself all from Apollon Network with the recently launched full masternode hosting service.\\r The full masternode service is Apollon Networks premium masternode hosting service. It is completely automated and once you have created the collateral transaction within your desktop wallet the Nodebuilder full masternode hosting service will select a VPS from within Apollon VPS pool, build the masternode on the VPS, validate the masternode against the local desktop wallet and configure the local wallet in order to control and start the masternode.  Once done the software completes a wallet restart and then activates the customers masternode all without any user interaction.\\r The full masternode hosting service is very competitively priced at $2.99 per masternode per month. User Nodebuilder accounts must be credited in advance of launching a masternode and only XAP (Apollon Network's own masternode coin) is accepted as payment.\\r Apollon Network has worked hard to bring one of the simplest and most advanced masternode hosting services on the market to it customers at a competitive and sustainable price.\\r OK well first off you should visit the Apollon Network website at https://www.apollon.network and download the Apollon Nodebuilder platform at this address https://www.apollon.network/download/ - once you have done that you will need to create a new account and credit it with XAP.\\r Next you just need to make sure you have your masternode desktop wallet set-up with the correct collateral transaction completed within the wallet and the Nodebuilder full masternode hosting service will take care of the rest!\\r And that it. You ready to rock and roll.\\r If you need further assistance you can find a demo video on how to use the Nodebuilder full masternode hosting service here. https://youtu.be/vA2HRbrBR1k\\r New customers on Apollon get a full 30 day money back guarantee. If you decide to use Apollon Network to host your masternodes and if, within 30 days, you are not satisfied with the service Apollon Network will refund the same amount of XAP you have deposited to your account during your trial period provided you request this within the first 30 days.  Because Apollon is so confident you will love the Apollon Network experience they are more than happy to offer this guarantee. This is a fairly unique commitment to its customers in this space and expresses how much they believe in the platform and service.\\r And secondly Apollon Network also run an affiliate scheme! Any customer who brings a new customer to the Apollon Network platform can earn $10 worth of service credit and the new customer also benefits from a nice welcome gift of $5 service credit. This is their way of thanking customers who help to spread the Apollon Network message and bring more customers to the platform.\\r As mentioned earlier in this article Apollon Network consists of most of the Apollon Investments Ltd old team minus the previous CEO plus one other new member,  the Apollon Network CEO, Dominik Myczkowski  Dominik hails from Austria and has been into cryptocurrencies and masternodes for a number of years and before he became the Apollon Network CEO he was a Nodebuilder customer! He loved the team and the service so much that when the opportunity surfaced to start the new project, Apollon Network, with the remaining team members it was a  brainer  Dominik is always looking out for new opportunities and partnerships for Apollon Network so if you want to talk about any of these topics he your man.\\r In addition to Dominic we also have:\\r Markus Dietrich, Coin Founder and Developer  Markus started Apollon and it coin, XAP, back in March 2018. He is also from Austria and is the brains behind the Nodebuilder software. He also provides 3rd line support and if anything new is developed on the platform you can bet it Markus who created it.\\r Minh Ta, Tech Support and Website Designer\\r Minh, who lives in Australia, joined the original Apollon project midway through 2018 and is the Apollon Network tech support guru and is responsible for the Apollon Network website and design thereof. He also helps define the Apollon Network marketing strategy with Dominik, the CEO.\\rLukas Plazovnik, Software Advisor\\r Lukas, also from Austria, is the coin listing dev. If a coin is listed on Nodebuilder it Lukas who puts in the time to build the new coin on the platform and do all necessary testing. He is always hard at keeping all the coins on the platform updated when teams make code changes to their projects and with around 100 coins on the platform he always toiling away keeping things ticking over.\\r And finally there myself.\\r Adrian Redman, Project Manager I joined the original project in May 2018 as project manager but this role pretty quickly developed and expanded. Now with Apollon Network I still provide project management services as needed but also manage our vibrant community and liaise with the teams we host on the platform and with our exchanges and other listing sites.\\r We are a very approachable team and if you have any questions please either drop us a line at hello@apollon.network or head on over to our Discord server on https://discord.gg/SmaxmwC  Until next time.\\r Happy noding!\\r Ade\\r Feel free to follow me on Twitter for updates when my next article lands on @Ade_Redman\\r More resources for Apollon:\\r Website  Twitter  Facebook  Discord\\r Masternode.live listing  Masternodes Online listing\\r  Coinmarket Cap listing - https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/apollon/Coin Gecko listing - https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/apollon-network\",\n",
       "  \"Disclaimer: the following info is provided for educational purposes only. Crypto trading is an activity related to high risks so only you responsible for the potential consequences. Also, biases are natural so the author also can be biased.\\xa0 Let begin with bad news: it impossible to overcome your biases completely. The catch is that psychological patterns are parts of humans at all. We born with them. We live with them. We die with them. But, most importantly, we trade with them.\\xa0 But there some good news, too. When a trader realizes that biases are eternal, he or she can research them for deeper understanding. As a result, it should be easier to identify the problem and overcome it. Partially, at least.\\xa0 Despite the full list includes dozens of lines, we want to talk about crypto trading biases in more detail.\\xa0 Did you know that 80% of individuals and 30% of institutions trade more inertially than logically? That the insight from Harvard Business School revealed in 2007. Today, the situation is similar because, yeah, biases don change.\\xa0 This led to the emergence of so-called behavioral finance  a science field that focuses on the role of psychology in trading and investing activities. It also researches emotions, sociological aspects, and even biology.\\xa0 We aren professionals in these fields but we traders. And we want to talk about the most popular issues.\\xa0 Definition: the anchor is the first piece of information that a trader spots. Later, it acts as the most significant and trusted point that limits alternative ideas.\\xa0 Example: a powerful bullish sign on a trading chart. Say, when you open a trading terminal and see that BTC/USDT pair forms a large bullish flag, it possible that you will trade according to it the entire day regardless of other indicators.\\xa0 Lesson: never rely on only one sign or opinion. Analyze the market from several points of view to get the full picture.\\xa0 Definition: traders tend to be more social than individual so they rely on news and actions of other market players. We buy when others buy and sell when others sell, especially focusing on crypto influencers. The problem is that attention bias may surpass the importance of more objective stuff like chart patterns.\\xa0 Example: after the news about listing at Binance, DOGE jumped from $0.0032 to $0.0044 in four hours. During the next week, the price slowly returned to $0.0032. That the power of news and mass trading when a token is pumped without actual reasons.\\xa0 Lesson: try isolating yourself from the crowd when trading. Obviously, you should do research and check news but don rely on them only. Sometimes, when you quick enough to jump in the wagon, you can get huge profits. The catch is to be among the first.\\xa0 Definition: it's probably the most natural bias of all examples. Basically, you can always find clear biases in trading stories of others but never spot your own faults. Long story short, people who live in glass houses shouldn throw stones.\\xa0 Example: for instance, you explored this article and decided to analyze trading patterns of your friends. You realize that he a captive of anchoring bias. The problem is you will not say the same about your own trading even if the decisions are identical.\\xa0 Lesson: know yourself and cooperate with other investors. It always a good idea to look at your trading from another angle.\\xa0 Definition: a very dangerous bias that leads to self-deception. The key idea here is that we appreciate signs that prove our thoughts. Respectively, we pay more attention to these indicators by ignoring those that contradict our opinion.\\xa0 Example: a trader has a bullish confirmation bias related to TRX/USDT pair. He or she decides to open a long position at $0.0315 paying high attention to bullish bars and expecting the uptrend. Thus, a trader ignores the fact that the bar has a small range while the next bearish bar is much wider. He/she even may not spot that the price closes below the support. Boom! We have $0.0278.\\xa0 Lesson: double-check your thoughts. When you see that everything's perfect, conduct another research and look for signs that contradict your views.\\xa0 Definition: it a special case of cognitive dissonance. We tend to justify our decisions even if they were totally wrong. This bias prevents you from closing unprofitable positions that destroy your capital.\\xa0 Example: you do your due diligence. You watch the market for a few hours. You analyze everything. You deny not as perfect trades. Finally, you open a long position just before the correction phase. You invested a lot of time in this deal so you refuse to close the position even after 10%, 20%, 30% dump, and so on.\\xa0 Lesson: Terrance Odean from Berkeley found that closed profitable positions still outperform open losing deals that remain in portfolios. Thus, you should follow the idea of cutting losses short. Just forget about previous decisions when you in. The money is spent already so try not to spend even more. Definition: it all about too high focus on each separate deal instead of looking globally. Framing forces you to forget about the portfolio and other deals. Example: a trader entered an unprofitable position when BTC went down to $10,000. Still, he or she forgets about pumping EOS that reached $6 and BCH at $420.\\xa0 Lesson: Harry Markowitz invented the modern portfolio theory according to which you should evaluate each position in terms of its effect on the entire portfolio, not this deal only. Accept short-term failures because you always can diversify and compensate them.\\xa0 Definition: the general theory assumes that people always opt for the highest return. However, Dan Kahneman and Amos Taversky report that traders are more likely to avoid losses than get the same profit. Thus, we rather win less than lose at all.\\xa0 Example: crypto traders often tend to move Stop Loss orders to perform a break-even strategy and liquidate risks. In this case, you risk even more to be kicked out of the next profitable move. It may be a good decision to use Trailing Stops, also.\\xa0 Lesson: study risk management and stick to it. Accept losses as they inevitable. Traders that aren ready to looses at all are bad traders with poor chances to succeed. Be sure to close deals at the right moment and stick to risk management strategy.\\xa0 Definition: we think that we control everything, including large market patterns and decisions of crypto whales. Actually, we don have this level of control. The worst moment is when overconfidence meets the Dunning-Kruger effect and traders fail to evaluate their abilities correctly.\\xa0 Example: there are dozens of overconfidence issues Particularly, pro traders who have enough experience think that they're the kings of the market. When you sure that the next trade will be profitable, you overconfident.\\xa0 Lesson: accept that there are things out of your sight and power. Try to develop a strategy which makes you feel comfortable in this uncertainty. Focus on things that you do control like emotions and your own actions instead of thinking about larger stuff.\\xa0 Definition: humans love history and pay too much attention to it. We evaluate investments and make predictions based on past experience only. The problem is that we trade with incomplete information.\\xa0 Example: two or three consecutive losses with a given coin pair or at similar patterns may prevent you from trading these assets or figures at all. Say, most likely, you will not trade actively at the BTC/USDT uptrend after two strong corrections and bear traps. Similarly, you may make false predictions that the coin will rise only because it increased in price for a few past days.\\xa0 Lesson: don rely on historical data only. Consider all sources of information and try to find the balance. Also, analyze trades in long-term time frames to get clearer insights on upcoming changes.\\xa0 Definition: long story short, traders think that their successes happen because of their experience while failures relate to external factors. All the good stuff is because of you while bad things are because of others.\\xa0 Example: here, everything depends on your emotions. Say, you closed an open ETH/USDT position with 1.5x profit and feel that it all because of your skills. Surely, no bullish trends Later, your open long order at the same market ended with a 2x loss. In this case, you blame whales, exchanges, Vitalik Buterin, and your dog. But not yourself... Lesson: remember our disclaimer? Be brave to take responsibility for all your actions without exclusions. Reward yourself for long-term profitable strategies and successful plans but not for single good trades. Also, it suggested to track deals and learn finance management.\\xa0 Congrats! You took the first towards accepting and fighting your biases. You learned about them. But there are more options to make the crypto trading safer and more consistent. Let look at these approaches: Design a plan and stick to it. Set rules, limits, and goals; define strategies; and never trade under emotions. The trickiest part is to find the balance between positive intuitive decisions and harmful impulses. Automated trading may help here.\\xa0 Do research constantly. The more info about markets you have the better. When you aren limited with a single source of information, you can make more elaborate trades. Especially, look for insights that contradict your attitude. Find reputable signals. Mass media generate noise all the time. You simply can trust all those experts and analytics so define the most trusted ones and focus on their ideas to avoid being overloaded with data. Ideally, push your own ideas, too.\\xa0 Keep a trading log. Journals are useful for backward analysis. Nearly all modern exchanges and terminals keep these logs automatically so you should check them regularly and draw conclusions.\\xa0 Learn new tricks. Always develop your trading style and expand knowledge base. Fresh insights and new vision angles are essential for the crypto industry. For example, you can invert charts to get another point of view. Take responsibility. It your money and your trading history. Only you can place entry and closing points, targets, Stop Loss levels, etc. Feel free to use any auxiliary info but accept the consequences, both good and bad.\\xa0 Understand and handle emotions. We humans. And we all different. Understand and accept your nature, find the best strategies, and use them. When you feel in harmony everything seems simpler.\\xa0 Crypto trading isn a cakewalk. There are angry whales who consumes hundreds of hamsters each day. There exorbitant volatility and a lot of FUD. Finally, there are traders with their biases  integral elements of human nature. Despite the fact that we can get rid of these psycho things, we can accept them.\\xa0 It all begins with research and understanding. Hope, this article helped to realize how harmful biases can be and how they can be mitigated. Return here sometimes. Don forget. Good luck!\",\n",
       "  'The Internet is undoubtedly fun; it full of cat gifs, absurdly random facts, and ingeniously enlightened ideas. But for every good thing, there tends to be its evil counterpart. According to a recent study done by the University of Maryland, hackers attack a computer once every 39 seconds. That more than 2,200 times a day. These are automated scripts that are just running, attacking computers at random, all the time. That just the generic hackers, too, who aren even after anything specific (yet). We going to throw some more numbers at you here, so ready yourself. According to another study, there are about 94 million cryptocurrency users in the United States, Australia, and Europe combined. You probably see where this is headed, right? 94 million people use cryptocurrency either on their phone, tablet, or computer, and excluding any specific attacks, they are already potentially being probed by hackers more than 2,000 times a day. Source: dilbert.com Scary, right? Don worry, there are plenty of things you can do to protect yourself, and ironically enough, a lot of them come in the form of things you should stop doing as well. It shouldn be a surprise that exchanges are a great source of information when it comes to educating yourself on this topic. They are, after all, the other half of the security equation. Right now, we going to highlight HitBTC and Binance in this article, as they both keep comprehensive security blogs for their users. So without further ado, here are the eight things to pay attention to: Have you ever copy-pasted an address when sending or trying to receive a crypto payment? Perhaps between exchanges, to your friend, or something else? Malware (particularly on your phone) can easily intercept and paste the wrong address instead of your intended one. Solution: Whitelisting When sending currency from an exchange like HitBTC or Binance, you can set up a whitelist of addresses that restrict your sending. This is a great option to ensure you don copy-paste the wrong thing. When sending from your own wallet, always triple-check every address (or at least glance at the first few and last few numbers). There are two exploits common with malicious software: hacked/fraudulent mobile apps and browser extensions. What happens here is basically an app on your phone or a browser extension accesses your 2FA, your passwords, your private keys, and so much more. Solution: Be smart about downloads When it comes to mobile apps and browser extensions, the former is easy, don download any apps onto your phone that you aren 100% sure about, even if it has nothing to do with crypto. The latter is even easier: don install browser extensions in the browser you use for crypto. If you HAVE to, then do everything you possibly can to ensure that they are 100% legit. If you want more info, check out HitBTC blog. Hacking is a strong term here, what these bots actually do is convince users that the bots are authentic support or staff members. The users then interact with the bots (let say, from  and give the bot/hacker crucial information during the interaction, such as their username and password.\\xa0 Solution: Limit interactions As you should do with many things in your life (always call your bank back at their listed number, for instance), double-check that the  or  user you are interacting with is actually legit. Here are some things real companies will never ask for: login ID and password together, to send coins anywhere to  help, private keys, the amount of crypto you hold, etc. Source: support.hitbtc.com Fake websites (often listed higher through paid advertisement) can bait users into clicking on them. These websites will look exactly like the real website (HitBTC, Binance, Metamask, etc.), but they will just be directing your information to hackers. Solution: HTTPS Always check to make sure that you are on a secure website. How? Easy. Look above this article, does the URL (website address at top of page) have  before it? That is what you want to look for when accessing any websites that have remotely anything to do with your crypto, your passwords, and anything else you rather keep secure. Those bots we mentioned before? They will often direct you to this type of unsecure link while  you in Telegram/Slack. When you store your passwords on Google Passwords, Evernote, PassLock, or any other third-party software you are basically putting all the keys to your life behind one lock. If a hacker breaks that one lock they now have access to your email, your exchanges, your 2FA, and possibly more. Solution: Write it down Yeah, remembering passwords is hard, we know. It really hard. In fact, it so hard that a lot of people use password-saving programs to store everything. Heck, we do it too, it easy. Storing some passwords is fine, but things like private keys, exchange passwords, and more should be written down on paper. Seriously, physical paper, written by hand, with a pen, and stored somewhere safe. Don print them! Printers cache data and can also be hacked. Write it by hand! There no sugar coating this - if you are using two-factor authentication being sent through SMS, you dancing with the devil. SMS can be so easily spoofed that you are basically just asking for hackers to take your data. Yes, it is so much easier than using a dedicated 2FA app, but never locking your house or car is easier than carrying keys around. Do you do that? Solution: Get a dedicated 2FA app We going to once again rely on HitBTC blog here again, since they have a pretty in-depth article explaining to their customers how to use 2FA with an app. The gist of it is that when setting up 2FA on your HitBTC account, you can connect that 2FA to an app like Authy or Google Authenticator to increase security. Remember, you lock your house and your car with special, specific keys - so you should do the same for your crypto investment. This shouldn have to be said, as you would think that people would have learned years ago that Nigerian princes aren looking to give you their vast fortunes, but some of us keep falling for it. Email phishing is simple; you receive an email in your inbox that seems legitimate when in reality it either leads you to a fake website while seducing you to engage in a one-way act (sending crypto to an unknown address, for instance) or install malicious software when you click on a file in the email. Solution: Don be a fish Seriously, don be a fish. Americans lost $26 million to email scams in 2018; that a whole lot of fish - were you one of them? Safe inbox practices include: Don open mail from addresses you don recognize, especially if the subject line isn relevant. Don expect to get anything for  in a  or  you send crypto to this specific address. Lastly, if ever in doubt, seek other opinions from people you trust. You on a wi-fi network you aren familiar with, perhaps on your phone (everyone connects to free wi-fi, right?) and you access your crypto account. Next thing you know, your account is no longer your account. Your passwords have changed, your funds are gone, and you locked out. What happened is that you sent data over an unsecured network and someone was listening to that data, now it theirs. Solution: Check your connections Make sure your phone doesn automatically connect to a wi-fi network without your consent. More importantly, using free wi-fi is perfectly fine, but don transmit sensitive data over it. You wouldn for instance, yell out your credit card numbers in a public place, right? That is what using unsecured wifi is like. You might as well be yelling out whatever it is you doing in a busy coffee shop. Looking at gifs of cats on unsecured wi-fi? Great, knock yourself out. Logging into HitBTC? Not a great idea. You done it, you made it through eight seemingly simple tips to keep your cryptocurrency secure. Maybe none of them helped you, maybe some of them did, or maybe you are a complete doofus who just learned what the Internet is and this has been a highly educational read. No matter how helpful this article was, it important to walk away remembering a few things. Source: xkcd.com Exchanges can only help protect your cryptocurrency only so far. The lengths they go to are vast, but it requires both the exchange and a competent user to ensure total security. HitBTC, for example, offers everything from 2FA to whitelisting, secure logins, https, IP filtering, and more - but none of that matters if you give your password away on Telegram to a user by the name of  These tips are cumulative, of course, and the more you integrate them into your daily life, the more it will make you less of a target. Hackers are just like everyone else: they want maximum profit with as little work as possible. All you need to do is be the least obvious target and make them work hard, so hard they don want to bother with you. Sounds easy enough, right?',\n",
       "  \"I a part-time trader. I trade on stock markets, and recently, at the beginning of 2019, I've tried trading on crypto markets.\\xa0 People often think that the life of a trader is swimming for hours on end in money, but that is so far from the truth. Sometimes you lose money, sometimes you think that you should have found a better application for your time instead of staring at the screen for half a day. But I love trading and I'm profitable most of the time. When I started trading crypto, it was a little bit overwhelming because the crypto market is open 24/7.\\xa0 I've adapted since then, and I want to share with you all the little tricks that I've learned about trading crypto, and how I've optimized my trading to be in the green without being chained to the trading interface. Hopefully you'll find my experience useful and avoid the mistakes I made.\\xa0 Being a trader, I don have a gold Rolex or a yacht. I don yell into my phone  SELL, SELL IT ALL RIGHT NOW, JOHNNY as ticker tape streams from the ceiling behind me. Also, I live in a normal house, not under the shadows of palm trees with beautiful women sitting on my lap (my wife wouldn like that very much). Sorry to say, I don live the stereotype that so many people have about traders.\\xa0 In reality, when I actively trade, it's a boring activity, that requires a special, non-dramatic mindset: Source: xkcd.com I spend a lot of my time watching the charts and price movement of various assets. I drink coffee to keep myself focused. Sometimes I go for a walk when I out of positions, but I often return to find, with great disappointment, that I missed some good opportunities, and it already too late to enter. But my first lesson that I learned by losing money was: you can afford to get distracted when you trading. The market can go the opposite direction, and you have to get out quick. If you don it can be really bad for you. So I have to spend a lot of time in front of my screen during trading hours. You know, coffee and red eyes; the trader starter pack. Don forget the constant stress when you not winning. And all of this got even worse when I entered the crypto market.\\xa0 For a day trader, the crypto market is a rollercoaster ride that never stops. You can get amused, or you can get nausea if you ride too much. It requires even more concentration, because it's open all hours of the day! It's basically a stock market on steroids. It took me some time to truly grasp that concept.\\xa0 The Toronto Stock Exchange is open for 7.5 hours every weekday, from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., so I wasn't accustomed to trading the whole day and night. Everything I've told you about markets applies to crypto too; you still need to watch all market movements, but it's stretched around a 24-hour period. Every 8 hours some large part of the world wakes up and starts trading. Asia, USA, Europe - all of them can dump or pump the market, and you have to respect that.\\xa0 If I have to compare the crypto market to the stock market, I would compare it to penny stocks - it goes up and down with crazy swings, and if you trade with leverage (which I don't recommend) you'll get liquidated very quickly. I didn't lose all my money by liquidation, but I know traders who did. Thus, the second lesson I've learned on the market by observing other traders is to never trade on margins. It's even more punishing in the crypto market simply because you often see price moving 20% during the day, and your wins and losses are multiplied by that much.\\xa0 Source: bullvestorbb.com Another thing that distinguishes crypto markets from the stock market is that it heavily based on trading patterns. Crypto doesn generate revenue, it doesn have quarterly reports to influence the price, so the most important thing is the trading patterns, and you have to watch out for them. It certainly not the most interesting thing in the world. At some point, I got really tired of trading that much, and I had to stop and reevaluate my approach to crypto. I wanted to live a life instead of stare at the screen. In my situation, I had three options: The first option didn't suit me at all, as you probably understand. I wasn't feeling any delight from trading every waking hour of the day. The second option was potentially dangerous for the safety of my funds, as only the trading gods know what can happen when you don have control over your money. Crypto is a very young industry, so it doesn have any established industry standards yet and I not ready to trust my money to any other person. That left me with only one option: trading bots.\\xa0 I wasn't familiar with trading bots before, so I tried a few of them; TradeSanta, Shrimpy, CryptoTrader, CryptoHopper, 3Commas. By reading the reviews, I guessed these were the most popular bots among crypto traders, and after much deliberation I finally made my choice. To this day, I still use TradeSanta.\\xa0 Lesson number three: my time is valuable too. I didn't want to spend it on such things as watching charts all day, every day, so I configured a trading bot that now trades according to its predetermined strategy; finding certain patterns, buying, and selling when necessary.\\xa0 My choice of TradeSanta was dictated by obvious reasons; I wanted a simple interface and an easy configuration. I'm no novice, but I love simplicity:\\xa0 That's how it makes money (for me!). Source: tradesanta.com The initial configuration isn't very complicated either. You set the parameters, choose the long and short strategy, and choose the trading pair. You can also choose the amount of extra orders (the orders to be executed if the price goes in the wrong direction). After that setup you choose the exchange you want to connect it to. Currently, you can choose from Bitfinex, Bittrex, HitBTC, Binance, and several others. BitMEX, OKEX, and Huobi are promised to be added in the future.\\xa0 Most importantly, it doesn't cost a fortune but it puts money in my pocket. I use a paid plan, but if you're a small-time trader, you can use the free plan, which gives you access to five bots. Fifteen dollars per month isn an expensive price to pay for all the help that I get from this bot. Which is precisely why I will continue using it in the future. For anyone who interested in using it, I would recommend starting from small volumes and expand if you find it comfortable. Not at all! But remember: the crypto market is a place where you can make a lot of money with its high volatility, but the market is just that volatile. In exchange for all these profits, though, you have to sacrifice all your free time, wake up at night to check your positions, or outsource it to a trading bot, like I did. Trading bots are trading tools, and there's nothing wrong with using one. Who would blame software that can make money 24/7 even when you asleep, when you're at work, or while you're out on the town spending some of that money? Not me. As a trader, I just getting started.\",\n",
       "  \"Lotteries can be traced back for centuries, and in some of the earliest cases the purpose of the lottery was to raise funds for some sort of community project. Of course, simple math dictates that if the lottery was designed to raise funds, that means that the total amount of the money being given away as a prize had to be less than the total raised. Queen Elizabeth I, for instance, ran a lottery to raise funds for the  of the havens and strength of the Realme, and towards such other publique good workes. Over time, lotteries became more popular. They helped fund the first permanent English settlement in the United States, and they are still used by many states in the US to raise funds. But from a player perspective, are they worth it? And if a standard lottery is worth it, could there be better options that increase not only the total award for players, but also ways to ensure no one is being scammed along the way? Lotteries handle big, big money, so isn it time we started keeping a closer eye on the whole business? (Source: abcnews.go.com)\\t Traditional lotteries are run all over the world by countries, states, cities, and more. These lotteries are most often used to fund projects that the lottery agency wants to complete; whether that project will benefit the public or not is up for debate. There are many different lotteries that people can play, and they all share one thing in common: odds. Odds are a funny thing. If you are playing a lottery where a certain number of tickets are sold, and one of those tickets will win for sure, your odds are based on the number of tickets sold. But modern lotteries have realized that there is a far more profitable method (profitable for them at least). Take, for example, one of the standard lottery games that is played worldwide: 6/49. In this game, the player chooses 6 numbers out of 49 numbers (typically 1-49), and the numbers are then typically drawn out of a machine that contains balls with the corresponding numbers printed on them. Seems easy, right? Well, there are a few things working against you here. First, statistics. The odds of choosing the correct six numbers (and these don even have to be in the correct order most of the time) is 1 in 13,983,816. Let give that number some perspective based on data for US citizens: Have you ever thought to yourself  have a good chance of dying from sunstroke? Didn think so. Odds are funny, and when our emotions get involved we tend to skew them to make ourselves feel better. But by that logic, buying traditional lottery tickets (especially in the 6/49 game) should give us more fear of the sun than hope for winning. That isn to say that people don win. People win all the time, even more so when they cheat. Eddie Tipton for example, a lottery employee, hijacked a few lotteries by altering their algorithms. He ended up raking in over $24 million dollars before he was eventually caught.\\xa0 Even when you aren competing against cheaters you aren't winning 100% of the money. In the United States, only about 63% of the money made through the lottery is paid out in winnings, while 6% is eaten up by administration fees. The other ~30% goes to whatever the states decide, dividing it up between various programs as they see fit.\\xa0 Source: onelotto.com High fees eat into lottery profits, the uncertainty of people cheating the lottery system, and costly operations. So, the most obvious solution here is the blockchain, right? After lotteries made their way online, the world of scams became ever more rampant. Online lotteries are even more fishy than online casinos, since the regulating bodies are even fewer and far in between. A majority of online lotteries are simply physical lotteries that have online access points (which you have to fulfill certain geographical and age restrictions to compete in), while others have a bit more of a Wild West approach. LotteryExposed has been tracking fraudulent lotteries since 2012 and has racked up quite an impressive list of online scams. As you expect, companies have easily put together that the blockchain, an immutable and easily verifiable technology, should go hand in hand with the lottery to ensure everyone is playing fair. Companies like Quanta and Fire Lotto are working hard to revolutionize the space by using the blockchain to monitor their lotteries, arrange for payments, and ensure that everything is trackable and fair. These companies address the problems of the lottery in a few key ways.\\xa0 First, they address the problem of fraud by running the RNG through a hash that is based on a blockchain; this takes care of cheaters since the number is verifiably random.\\xa0 Second, they give out more in winnings since they have far lower administrative and operational fees than traditional lotteries. For instance, both Quanta and Fire Lotto award lottery prizes containing 70% of the money raised through ticket sales. Wait, that isn much better than the 63% that US lotteries offer on average. But, at least since they offer the ability for users to pay with cryptocurrency they are open to users around the world. Also, since these companies launched their own coins during their ICOs they give players a chance to reinvest their winnings back into the lottery in an effort to win more money before withdrawing, right? Well, technically yes, but it wouldn have been the best plan. When looking at total ROIs for each of these coins: FireLotto (-93.36%), Quanta (-51.72%). It would seem that these blockchain lottery companies weren actually trying to create a fair lottery on the blockchain, instead they realized that creating a fair lottery on the blockchain was just an easy way to get rich through high fees (30% per lottery). They had no plans of keeping their coin stable. There is another option, though, and that using a blockchain to run a lottery while giving 100% of earnings to lottery players. YOUnited is taking this approach, and time will tell if we be seeing their total ROI in red or black. Their approach is a bit more unique than just slapping the blockchain solution onto an existing problem, instead they are actually trying to revolutionize the space by simply making their blockchain the rule enforcer for both lotteries and casinos. It is simple, really, and may work out brilliantly so long as they can keep the ball rolling. Their approach isn to charge an exorbitant fee for each lottery (honestly, taking 30% of the total winnings in a blockchain lottery is absurd), instead they will charge a 1% smart contract execution fee that is applied only post-game to the winnings, and a small (0.1%) transfer fee on their blockchain. Most of that 1% fee goes back into the YOUnited economy, which helps cover incentive programs that they run to entice new players to their games. We have constant examples in the blockchain world where a company tries to take too much, too fast, with too little regard for the community they serve. They seem to see the potential for long-term growth with their community and is working to create a sustainable community that will earn them smaller profits, but these profits will continue over a far longer period of time than companies that charge high fees and burn out fast. YOUnited definitely has better odds of success than Quanta and FireLotto, if only because they are looking to earn a steady income stream instead of striking it rich in one swift move. Source: xkcd.com Nevertheless, lotteries are a gamble, literally, and whether they are a waste of money is up to each individual person to decide for themselves. With a traditional lottery you are faced with absurd odds, long payout times, and a huge cut out of your winnings for taxes, fees, and more. Blockchain lotteries, however, can definitely fix these issues, but as with any type of gambling, be sure to research your options before diving in. Gamble safe, dear reader, and have fun out there.\",\n",
       "  \"(Read Part 1 here) In this section below, we will discuss different decentralize cloud storage solutions. Many of them are available in the market today, and they are built on top of the IPFS protocol or use the variance of it. Many people confuse IPFS as being a blockchain itself, while it merely a protocol that can enable many blockchain platforms to build solutions on top of it. Filecoin is a blockchain-based decentralized storage solution that incentivizes users with unused space on their hard drives to host chucks of data. Filecoin is built on top of IPFS by Protocol Labs, the same guys who build the IPFS, which makes it even more exciting. Users can join the Filecoin storage market to rent their hard drives, single disks, racks, whole data centers, or every Terabyte they are not using. Filecoin has four kinds of groups in its network, each providing different sets of functionalities. Clients are the people who pay for storage.Storage Miners are the people who rent their storage and host data for the client.Retrieval miners are the middlemen who get the data from client to storage miners, or give data back from storage miners to clients.Full nodes nodes validate the entire Filecoin network, calculate available storage capacity, determine prices, and validate all actions of clients, retrieval miners, and storage miners. According to CoinMarketCap, one Filecoin (FIL) is trading for $5.7 as of July 2019 with a daily 24h trading volume surpassing $3 Million. Sia is another decentralized cloud storage platform that aims to become the Uber of data storage. It operates just like Filecoin and connects  who have storage space to rent, and  who are looking for storage space. Sia claims that their decentralized cloud storage costs around less than 90% from the leading cloud storage providers like Amazon or Google. With the prices as low as $2/TB/month, it makes Sia, a strong contender in the cloud storage space. Unlike Filecoin, Sia puts much effort into data security. It uses something called  Redundancy to ensure data integrity, privacy, and security. Every piece of data stored on Sia is replicated across 30 different devices, in many different locations of the world, which decreases the risk of data loss and ensures the integrity of the data. Also, all files stored on the Sia network are encrypted and password protected, which means that the  don know what is stored inside their rented storage space. As of July 2019, Sia has\\xa0: over 2 PB of decentralized storage space;331 independent storage providers;437 TB of used storage space and 1.2 M downloads. According to CoinMarketCap, Siacoin (SC) has surpassed a total market cap of $124 Million with a 24h daily trading volume of over $1.5 Million. Storj is another decentralized cloud storage solution which is now rebranded as Tardigrade. Unlike Sia or Filecoin, Storj has a very robust mechanism of storing and distributing the files into four different steps: Encrypt data is first encrypted on your machineShred its File Sharding algorithm, your data is split between many different shards.Distribute of the encrypted shards of data is distributed across the network.Audit full nodes audit the network all the time, ensuring the right storage capacity, addressing, data integrity, and availability. With the lowest cost of $0.015 per GB per month, Storj aims to become the most affordable and decentralized cloud storage on the planet. According to CoinMarketCap, Storj (STORJ) is currently trading at $0.29 and has surpassed a total market cap of $39 Million with a daily 24h trading volume of just over $9 Million (as of July 2019). PPIO is another decentralized data storage platform especially aimed towards the developers. It provides a range of different tools for developers like SDK and CLI and supports all the major languages. Just like Amazon S3, PPIO supports object-based data storage into blobs, which makes it is very efficient when storing or serving large media files across many different nodes. According to their website, they provide different application and hosting scenarios like: Decentralized AppsMedia StreamingPrivate Data StorageData ExchangeData WarehousingEnterprise Data Storage. Their focus is pretty much on affordability, privacy, and security, efficiency, and stability. PPIO wants to become the next Google Cloud or Amazon S3 on the blockchain. From its current development, it seems very promising, and it has the potential to become the underlying architecture for many decentralized apps in the future.  Internxt, the parent company behind X Cloud is creating  internet services for the common user who wants true ownership of their data. They built X Cloud, a secure and decentralized cloud storage solution that strives to replace existing services like Dropbox, iCloud, or Google Drive with more privacy and security. X Cloud has a very robust decentralized network of nodes known as the X Core network, where all your files are distributed. What unique about X Cloud is that privacy and security are in their main focus. They are truly  with  end-to-end encryption Before distributing your files to the X Core network, all your files are segmented into different chunks of blocks, which are further secured with zero-knowledge end-to-end encryption, making X Cloud the most secure cloud storage platform on the planet. All of your data doesn sit on anyone's central location, it fully encrypted and distributed among many different nodes across the X Core network. On X Cloud, you can securely share your files by inviting users with a private link to give them access to either view or safely edit your shared files. They also have a very intuitive dashboard to manage your files in one place. Also, X Cloud uses something called  which they claim, would significantly improve the scalability of the network. X Cloud offers a free 1GB plan to its users, while the 100GB package starts at 4.49 The first stable version of X Cloud was launched on March 27th, 2019, and since then, it getting a lot of attention and has partnered with organizations like Blackberry and Y-Combinator. Hosts who would participate in the X Core network would be paid with INXT coins, which is the only means of payment of the network.\\xa0 Another exciting decentralized cloud storage solution is 0Chain, a company born out of Silicon Valley. 0Chain is building 0Box, the next generation, highly secure and decentralized cloud storage (dStorage) platform. 0Box is the first enterprise-grade decentralized storage (dStorage) offering  security and a high-performance blockchain platform for the users. With end-to-end encryption, your files are secure from the indiscreet eyes. Apart from high security and innovative consensus protocol of 0Chain, 0Box lets you share your files quickly and easily, with a feature that lets you monitor who is downloading your file and from which location. The company claims that 0Chain, which powers the 0Box dStorage platform, is the fastest blockchain platform that is infinitely scalable due to its unique storage and token protocol. Users can  their tokens with the 0Chain wallet to earn  while providing services to the network, or utilizing different services of the network. Saswata Basu, one of the founders of 0Chain, claimed that aside from providing a decentralized storage platform, 0Box would let users earn directly by sharing with their consent their data with companies. Another essential thing to note about 0Box is that the product is too much focused on the enterprise. Saswata Basu claimed in the same blog post that 0Box would be compliant with all the enterprise and industry regulations, such as HIPAA for healthcare and also GDPR. According to CoinMarketCap, 0Chain (ZCN) is currently trading at $0.067 and with a total market cap of $2,6Million (as of July 2019). Another up-and-coming company providing decentralized cloud storage is Opacity. One of the most significant focus of Opacity is user privacy. Users can pay directly with their OPQ tokens, to avoid giving out their personal data via credit card while making an online payment for the service.OPQ is an ERC20 token that also serves as a means of payment to storage providers on the Opacity network. Keeping in view the privacy concerns, Opacity gives a unique identified to its users known as the  Handle This account handle is the private key that users can use to log in, and it acts as a  account credential Users aren required to give out their personal information, and they can use the account handle to access their Opacity storage account. Not only the privacy, Opacity takes great care of the security too. When a user uploads a file, it divided into 64kb blocks, which is then further encrypted with 256bit AES-GCM encryption before distributing to the Opacity storage network. Moreover, all files on the Opacity storage network are linked to users via ECDSA instead of a traditional pair of email/password. As of July 2019, Opacity (OPQ) has surpassed the market cap of $3.9 Million with a daily 24h trading volume of over $48,000. The total supply of OPQ tokens is fixed at 130 Million. BitTorrent is arguably the largest peer-to-peer (p2p) file-sharing protocol on the planet, and with the TRON Blockchain platform, it aims to tokenize this file sharing platform with incentives for content creators. BTT would allow the content creators to connect with their audience and earn a fair share without having any middleman. Recently, the company has announced that they are adding decentralized and peer to peer file storage to the existing TRON based application. BitTorrent would add the BitTorrent File System (BTFS) to allow users to receive and host storage on their computers. A variant of the open-sourced IPFS protocol. BTFS has begun testing internally in late May 2019 and is the first step of creating a distributed web platform. The Mainnet of the BTFS would be launched in Q3 of 2019 for public access. BTFS would also power those applications built on the TRON blockchain platform, which needs a decentralized storage system. All TRON based applications would leverage the power of BTFS to enhance their functionality. BTFS would use the TRON blockchain platform, which would make it very scalable and secure. With over 100 million people already using BitTorrent, we don know yet how BitTorrent and TRON would surprise us with the BTFS. As of July 2019, Opacity (OPQ) has surpassed the market cap of $3.9 Million with a daily 24h trading volume of over $48,000. The total supply of OPQ tokens is fixed at 130 Million. NEO, coming straight out of China is often termed as  Ethereum of China Being in the list of top 20 biggest blockchain platforms, NEO has accumulated a total market cap of over $1 Billion. Recently, the team behind NEO has announced that they are building NeoFS, a decentralized and distributed file storage on the Neo public blockchain. Since Neo is a public programmable blockchain platform, it allows the developers to build decentralized applications (DApps) on its platform. With the introduction of NeoFS, these DApps would be able to leverage the power of distributed file storage, which would enhance the functionality for the kind of apps which need consistent storage. NeoFS is still under development, and the work began in Q4 of 2018. According to Neo, the NeoFS would take great care of security and anonymity. NeoFS would also be having the functionality of compatibility and integration with existing leading cloud storage providers like Amazon S3 or Dropbox. The architecture and data auditing methods have been developed for NeoFS to guarantee data integrity, placement, and availability, which would ensure a reliable and trustless user experience. According to its website, Dfinity is  3.0 the Internet as a cloud that hosts secure software and open mass-market services Dfinity compares itself to AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure as a decentralized alternative to the existing cloud computing platforms. With its first steps, Dfinity wants to focus on companies and provide mass hosting for enterprise IT systems. One important feature to discuss Dfinity is that it fully compatible with the Ethereum blockchain and its smart contracts. Dfinity Internet Computer project essentially aims to extend the Internet. Today Dfinity primarily provides connectivity between devices. In the future, their open protocols will also allow it to behave like a decentralized operating system or a serverless cloud. Upon which they want the world to host its next generation of software, services, and data. Dfinity is still in the development phase, and we are yet to see what they can come up with. The decentralized cloud storage space is very new, and there is still a lot of space left for new entrants to provide different platforms for the users. Let compare each one of the solutions that we have discussed above. Filecoin by the same guys who built the IPFS protocol. Filecoin is a solution for individual users to store their data an alternative to DropBox. Filecoin is building on IPFS, which ensures scalability, robustness, and security. With over a $257 million raised in the ICO, Filecoin is still in the development phase. However, it has announced a lot of partnerships with leading organizations like the Ethereum Foundation. Sia is more targeted towards the consumer market, providing them with an alternative to other cloud storage providers. It positions itself and compares it to Amazon and Google. I think this could be the best-decentralized cloud storage solution for the public. Storj like Sia, StorJ is also targeted towards the consumer, but they are more focused on encryption and distribution. With a similar set of features, Storj can be considered as the closest competitor to Sia. PPIO is very different from all the decentralized cloud storage solutions that we have discussed in this article. PPIO is solely made for the developers community, providing an alternative to Google Cloud or Amazon S3, etc. Just like Filecoin, PPIO is more of a platform for hosting decentralized applications. X Cloud by Internxt the lowest cost and intuitive dashboard, I think X Cloud can become a very prominent company in the consumer-facing environment. Its packages are cleverly designed, and with the option to purchase packages in fiat currency, X cloud also caters to the audience who isn yet crypto-hungry. 0Box by 0Chain best thing about 0Box is that the company behind it, the 0chain is solely focused on building the fastest blockchain platform catered towards decentralized cloud storage only. This focus gives them a distinctive edge. Also, with their claims of user data monetization and revenue-sharing model, 0Box has a lot to offer than just the storage. Opacity puts a lot of focus into the privacy along with simplicity. It lets users pay in the tokens and don share any information. Instead of email and password, Opacity gives a unique identifier called the  handle which is the only thing you need to access all your files. BTFS by BitTorrent (BTT) than focusing on the consumer storage segment, BTFS by BitTorrent is focused on building the decentralized storage layer for the TRON network. TRON is a public and programmable blockchain just like Ethereum, and with BTFS, it will enable developers to leverage the power of  with their DApps. We can say that it would be more focused on the TRON DApp developers instead of regular consumers. NeoFS by NEO like BTFS, NeoFS would be the decentralized storage layer for the NEO network. NEO is another public programmable blockchain platform, just like Ethereum and TRON. With NeoFS, developers who built DApps would be able to leverage the power of decentralized storage for their applications. Just like BTFS, NeoFS would be more focused on the developers instead of the consumers. Dfinity is purely focused on companies, and instead of focusing on  Dfinity wants to establish itself as THE decentralized cloud computing platform (like Microsoft Azure). Dfinity is probably the first company with the sole focus on the cloud computing platform and wants to take the legacy IT systems to the cloud using its platform. Blockchain is a revolutionary technology, and its applications can be stretched out beyond just payments. These solutions can not only make the internet decentralize again, but it can also help to break  monopoly by making it more open, accessible, neutral, censorship-resistant, and border-less. With the increasing incidents of data and security breaches and censorship across the globe, these decentralized cloud storage solutions and protocols can act as a savior, pushing the boundaries of innovation even further.\",\n",
       "  'In my Libra project analysis report ( A Business Analysis of the Libra Project), I pointed out that there is still a very good opportunity to develop a new stablecoin that competes with Libra. The Libra project is definitely not the end of the stablecoin project, but a milestone in this process. More stablecoin projects will appear to provide more stablecoin products for the market. In terms of the mechanism for generating stablecoins, other stablecoin products can be substantially different from Libra. In terms of application scenarios of stablecoin, a more suitable application scenario can also be adopted. In view of the fact that stablecoin is still at a very early stage and all the risks of the Libra project, other stablecoin products still have a very high probability of success. As long as the correct strategy is adopted in the design of stablecoin, promotion organization and adoption scenario, it is very likely that the new stablecoin can be better accepted by the market. This article discusses some of the factors related to the new stablecoin. The first thing that should be made clear is that a stablecoin project should not be a stand-alone infrastructure stablecoin project. In other words, one should not start a project just to make a stablecoin. Because of the currency nature of stablecoin, it cannot be hoped to make a profit from the stablecoin itself. Stablecoin should be used as a tool to support other businesses. Only when such a business develops can the stablecoin develop simultaneously. This is just like the development of Alipay with the development of online shopping. The development process of stablecoin should also be the same. Such a mechanism is also the motivation for Facebook to develop stablecoin. Facebook purpose in developing a stablecoin was not just to launch a stable digital currency that can be used worldwide. Although the purpose of the project, according to the whitepaper, is to provide financial services to 1.7 billion people without financial services worldwide, Facebook goal is to help Facebook provide financial services to its users, so it can achieve business growth. This is the true purpose of Facebook to develop this product. The actual goal of this stablecoin project is to be used by Facebook main business, not just to develop a stablecoin itself. But such a business logic does not seem to be seen by all the stablecoin providers. For service providers who only offer a stablecoin solution and no other main business, the profitability challenge will be enormous. Future stablecoins will exist in two forms (See my article in Chinese, Predicting the Development Trend of Stablecoin Based on Money Theories). One is a digital version of the fiat currency issued by each central bank. The essence of this digital stablecoin is credit currency. The other is a stablecoin that is minted in a distributed manner and based on collateralized digital assets. The essence of this stablecoin is commodity currency. This mechanism follows the tradition of Bitcoin. It relies on technology and market to guarantee the generation and circulation of this stablecoin. Various stablecoins currently in the market are issued on collateralized fiat currencies and are pegged to one single fiat currency. The only difference between them is whether it accepts a single fiat currency or several fiat currencies. Such a stablecoin is actually a derivative of fiat currencies, and it is in essence a credit currency. The attributes of such a digital stablecoin still dependent upon the attributes of the fiat currency that it is pegged to. In my opinion, such stablecoin is only a transitional state of the stablecoin product. After central banks issue their own digital fiat currencies, such stablecoin will be phased out in the market. Stablecoin that is developed in a distributed manner and based on collateralized digital assets will be accepted in the market for a long time. With the development of blockchains and encrypted digital assets, it has been found that smart contracts can be used to represent various rights and assets. Digital assets represented by smart contracts on the blockchain not only have richer attributes, but also embedded business rules. Most importantly, the digital assets represented by smart contracts can be traded directly between accounts on a blockchain. The process of using smart contracts to represent assets has already started. The state of Delaware, USA, has legally recognized company shares registered on the blockchain. Some types of alternative assets such as real estate and private equity funds are being represented as security tokens. Such security tokens are used to raise money and being circulated in the secondary market. Due to the limits of current US securities regulation, users that can invest in and trade such assets are very limited. However, there are now two companies that are applying to SEC to set up digital security exchanges. Such digital security exchanges will provide trading services to these security securities. In Switzerland, the Swiss Stock Exchange has established the Swiss Digital Exchange SDX. The Swiss Stock Exchange expects that the products traded in SDX will supersede those traded on the Swiss Stock Exchange in the next decade. Future digital assets will be traded in exchange to obtain fair pricing. The exchange will be global in nature and will be more transparent. The operation mechanism of the exchange will be a mode of centralized trading and distributed clearing. This will provide a solid foundation for issuing stablecoin based on digital assets. Digital assets listed and traded on the exchange provide the asset base for a commodity-based stablecoin. In the history of currency development, the currency before fiat currency was commodity currency. The basis of such commodity currencies are usually gold and silver. It was later that government credit was used as the foundation of currencies. A major problem with credit-based currencies is government unrestricted ability to issue money. This situation has existed since the emergence of fiat currency. It has appeared in the history of China and other parts of the world. And it still continues to happen. Money oversupply inevitably leads to financial and economic crises. This is the inherent flaw of fiat currency itself. Of course, we shouldn deny the value of fiat currency because of this. Fiat currency has played an important role in the development of the modern economy. But, in today society, with the development of the internet and blockchain technology, there is now an opportunity to produce a new type of money that is minted with lower cost and can be used worldwide in a more efficient way. Such a stablecoin can avoid the destructive effects of some sovereign countries monetary policies. In the future, digital currencies based on sovereign government credit and digital stable money based on digital assets will coexist and compete in the market. This will force each currency to maintain its quality. The stable development of global economy therefore can be better guaranteed. In the current US securities market, security token is being used to digitize assets and is being traded in the secondary market. Although the types of assets currently developed in this way are only part of alternative assets and are only a small number of all asset types, the benefits that this approach can achieve are already significant. These alternative assets such as real estate and private equity funds are now being customized into much smaller and standardized units, and these units can be traded on a more efficient and low-cost network. Both liquidity and premium have been significantly improved. This mechanism for asset digitization can also be applied to mainstream asset types such as company equity. Such an application will not only increase the liquidity and premium of mainstream assets, but also significantly increase the overall efficiency of the capital market (see my article in Chinese, The Twilight of Nasdaqs). In fact, the current global capital market has formed a consensus on this. The Swiss Digital Asset Exchange is the leading practitioner in this area. There are also two companies in the United States that are applying to the SEC to establish such digital securities exchanges. The two companies are the Miami International Holdings (MIH) and Templum joint venture and the BOX exchange with tZERO joint venture, respectively. Digitization of asset and currency is a trend. But where does this trend start? The application of digital currency must begin at where existing currencies do not serve well. Such areas include regions where sovereign currencies lose their credibility such as current Venezuela, or regions where sovereign currencies are not used conveniently such as cross-border transactions and transfers. In various cross-border transactions, digital assets trading on a global scale is inconvenient using fiat currencies. In fact, the earliest stablecoin Tether was created to facilitate the trading of digital assets for users around the world. The main application scenarios for some stablecoins that have emerged since then are also in the field of digital asset trading. Most importantly, digital asset trading is growing worldwide. It has shown a strong growth trend. This growth will certainly drive the growth of stablecoins. This is like the rapid growth of online shopping led to an urgent need for a mechanism to ensure the completion of transactions. This led to the emergence of Alipay. Alipay has grown with the growth of online shopping. It later developed into an independent payment instrument and clearing network. Such a digital asset exchange must be a combination of centralized trading and distributed clearing. Users manage their digital assets on the underlying chain or have them stored by third-party custodian companies on the same chain. When the user conducts a transaction, the centralized matching mechanism performs the transaction matching, and the matched order is directly cleared and settled between accounts. The two-tiered clearing arrangement in the current securities market is therefore not needed. The efficiency of the transaction will be higher, the cost will be lower, the market risk of the client funds will be smaller, and the utilization of funds will be higher. The development of blockchain technology has led to innovation in more fields. One of them is innovation in organizational form. Bookkeeping on the blockchain is passed through the consensus of all nodes before it can be recorded on the chain. Such bookkeeping methods have spurred the development of membership-type organizational form. In the development of Ethereum, it tried to decide on the development of the blockchain based on the voting of the Ethereum community by means of DAO (Distributed Autonomous Organization). Although The DAO organization did not go well, it has inspired more attempts in this area since then. CENTER which is jointly supported by Coinbase and Circle (See my article in Chinese, Why Does Circle and Coinbase Jointly Supported USDC Can Develop into a Real Stablecoin?), Fnality which is supported by UBS and other financial institutions (See my article in Chinese, Fnality, a Milestone in the Evolution of Financial Market Infrastructure), and the Libra association can be said to be the inheritance and development of this organization type. Of course, membership-based companies have long existed. For example, credit cooperatives in the financial industry and the Option Clearing Corporation that I used to work for are such organizations. However, such an organizational form is usually confined within a small geographical area or an industry within one legal jurisdiction. Such organizations cannot expand globally. The emergence of blockchain technology provides a solid foundation for supporting the expansion of this organizational form on a global scale. Organization rules can be programmed into smart contracts and run automatically. The fairness of this organization can therefore be guaranteed. Any company anywhere in the world that meets the requirements of such an association can join and has the assurance that the fairness of this organization can be guaranteed. The Libra Association can be said to be a recent attempt in this regard. Its current governance mechanism is still the traditional way, but I believe that it will gradually program more governance rules into smart contracts. In the securities industry, I believe that future digital asset exchange must be a digital asset exchange (See my article in Chinese, The Next Blockchain-based Cross-border Financial Alliance) formed by a consortium of securities firms around the world. Its organizational form will also be a governance mechanism supported by blockchain technology. The goal of such an exchange is to attract more security firms to participate and make this ecosystem bigger on a global scale. Fair and reasonable business rules based on blockchain technology support are the basis for attracting brokers from all over the world. With the participation of security and investment firms around the world, assets worldwide can be listed and traded on this exchange, which will provide sufficient underlying assets for issuing stablecoins. In the scenario of this exchange, the value of the new stablecoin is based on the digital assets traded on the exchange. Since the exchange trading is 7 x 24 hours worldwide, the valuation of these digital assets is therefore a fair one. The value base of the stablecoin issued this way is therefore a consensus result of the market. In the current banking and securities industry, collateral management is a day-to-day business. The asset owner uses its own assets as collateral to borrow some funds from other parties. When the owner finishes using the fund, it will return the fund plus some interests to redeem the assets that have been collateralized. In stock exchange market, one type of asset that is often used as collateral is security. High quality security and good liquidity make them ideal for lending as collateral. In the context of digital asset trading, some high-quality digital assets can also be used to generate stablecoins. At present, there is a distributed mode represented by MakerDAO which accepts digital assets on Ethereum as collaterals. As technology evolves, more types of digital assets can be used to mint stablecoins in the same way. Even for digital assets that cannot be coined in this way, in this exchange scenario, coinage can be done in a centralized collateral and custody manner. Therefore, the asset base of the stablecoin is even greater. More stablecoins therefore can be minted this way. Libra is based on fiat currencies and short-term government bond collateral. This model of issuing stablecoin based on asset collateral is commonly used in the market today. Prior to Libra, digital stablecoins such as USDC were generated based on US dollar collaterals. So Libra is an improvement in using collateral assets to issue stablecoins. The new stablecoin proposed in this paper is based on actual assets listed and traded on the exchange, so the value base of the new stablecoin is a further improvement over the Libra stablecoin. The Libra stablecoin price is pegged to a basket of fiat currencies. Price of stablecoins before Libra is pegged to US dollar. Therefore Libra price is more stable. The new stablecoin proposed in this paper will be pegged to a basket of fiat currencies for a long time in the future. Such a mechanism is a viable one. The difference between the new stablecoin and Libra is fiat currencies in the basket and their respective weights. Libra clearly states in its whitepaper that it does not have its own independent monetary policy. Libra monetary policy is entirely dependent upon the monetary policies of fiat currencies in the basket it is pegged to. Similarly, for a long time in the future, the new stablecoin will not have its own independent monetary policy. It will also depend entirely on the monetary policies of fiat currencies in the basket. In this respect, Libra has improved compared to the previous stablecoins, because the monetary policy of previous stablecoins is completely dependent on US dollar. The fluctuation of Libra stablecoin due to changes in monetary policy is therefore much smaller. The amount of Libra circulation in the market is entirely dependent on the needs of the market. This quantity mechanism is same as previous dollar-based stablecoins. The new stablecoin is no exception in this respect. This stablecoin is actually a derivative of existing fiat currencies, so the amount of circulation in the market should also depend entirely on the amount of circulation of fiat currencies in the basket. Libra direct coinage income is the interests proceeds from collateralized fiat currencies and short-term government bonds. Income obtained this way is not high and may even be negative. The coinage tax of Libra previous stablecoins is also generated from interests of collateralized US dollars. The new stablecoin is able to obtain a slightly higher income for seigniorage tax because it is issued and circulated in the exchange environment. The exchange can support the coinage business in the form of collective lending. In other words, the exchange provides a stablecoin-based financing service. Traders can borrow stablecoins from the exchange for their own leveraged trading. The exchange derives revenue from this business and allocates a portion of the proceeds as a coinage tax to participants. The table below shows a comparison of the new stablecoin with the Libra stabilized currency. The fundamental difference between the new stablecoin and the Libra stablecoin is the value base. The Libra stablecoin is still essentially a credit currency. The value of the new stablecoin is based on digital assets, so it is in essence a commodity currency. Both currencies have their own characteristics. The coexistence and competition between the two in the market will bring better choices for the market in terms of currency. Libra underlying blockchain is developed for circulation of Libra stablecoin. But it also supports the application of smart contracts. Therefore, more complex financial products such as stocks can be circulated in this blockchain. The underlying blockchain of the new stablecoin must first support the clearing and settlement of digital assets. It therefore needs to support digital currency and more complex financial products from the very beginning. The goal of Libra is to provide a financial infrastructure on a global scale to serve the world 1.7 billion unbanked and underbanked population. This is indeed a viable business strategy to promote stable coins. I analyzed this in a previous article (See my article in Chinese, How to Use Blockchain to Bring Paradigm Shift to the Global Personal Loan Industry?). This area is currently an area that mainstream financial institutions do not serve well. The emergence of blockchains and stablecoin now provides an opportunity to make improvement in this area. Facebook can use its social network to provide stablecoin-based financial services to its users worldwide. The initial application scenario for the new stablecoin is digital asset trading. Such an application scenario is in line with the actual needs in the market and is an area of  growth. Therefore, the new stablecoin will gradually be adopted in the market. Although the initial application of the two stablecoins will focus on weak areas of the existing fiat currency services, the new stablecoin is used in a smaller application range and its spillover effect is therefore smaller. The circulation of Libra stablecoin is global. Although it will focus first on the people who are not able to access financial services, its actual application in the real world will certainly not be carried out in full accordance with the expectations of the project. Therefore, the impact of Libra on the existing financial system can be very large. In addition, since Libra stablecoin is pegged to a basket of fiat currencies and accepts fiat currency collateral to generate Libra stablecoins, it will certainly have an impact on existing fiat currencies. This will bring a lot of uncertainty to current fiat currencies, which is not something that central banks like to see.',\n",
       "  'One of my mentors in artificial intelligence( AI) always says that with modern machine learning technologies you can find almost any answer but the hard thing is to ask the right questions. That principle certainly applies to crypto-assets. As a new financial asset class, crypto-tokens are, more often than not, evaluated using traditional metrics based on price and volume but we can do so much more. In a data-rich universe where blockchains and exchange data generates billions of data points, we can certainly find all sorts of fascinating patterns and factors that explain behaviors in crypto-assets. The hard thing is to know what to look for. Who would you describe Ethereum? Based on the price? As a blockchain? Based on the decentralized applications(DApps) built on top of it? Understanding the behavior of crypto-assets starts by asking the right questions. A lot of our questions about crypto-assets are targeted to determine relationships with price movements (what else ð\\x9f\\x98\\x89 ) but the analysis could go so far beyond that. Very often, non-obvious correlations provide the greatest insights. During World War II, the Pentagon assembled a team of the country most renown mathematicians in order to develop statistical models that could assist the allied troops during the war. The talent was astonishing. Frederick Mosteller, who would later found Harvard statistics department, was there. So was Leonard Jimmie Savage, the pioneer of decision theory and great advocate of the field that came to be called Bayesian statistics. Norbert Wiener, the MIT mathematician and the creator of cybernetics and Milton Friedman, future Nobel prize winner in economics were also part of the group. One of the first assignments of the group consisted of estimating the level of extra protection that should be added to US planes in order to survive the battles with the German air force. Like good statisticians, the team collected the damage caused to planes returning from encounters with the Nazis. For each plane, the mathematicians computed the number o bullet holes across different parts of the plane (doors, wings, motor, etc). The group then proceeded to make recommendations about which areas of the planes should have additional protection. Not surprisingly, the vast majority of the recommendations focused on the areas with that had more bullet holes assuming that those were the areas targeted by the German planes. There was one exception in the group, a young statistician named\\xa0Abraham Waldwho recommended to focus the extra protection in the areas that hadn shown any damage in the inventoried planes. Why? very simply, the young mathematician argued that the input data set( planes) only included planes that have survived the battles with the Germans. Although severe, the damage suffered by those planes was not catastrophic enough that they couldn return to base. therefore, he concluded that the planes that didn return were likely to have suffered impacts in other areas. Very clever huh? What Wald story teaches us is that, no matter how sophisticated the mechanism for analyzing data, asking the wrong questions will get us nowhere. When comes to an unknown universe such as crypto-assets, that premise holds truer than ever. We know the price and  volume of any crypto-assets but what other factors do we need in order to understand the behavior of this new asset class? If we use price as the driving factor for most of our questions, then it is key to understand the types of relationships we can extrapolate between prices and other factors. At a high level, there are some characteristics about the relationships between two variables that are important. \\xa0Correlation vs. Causality:\\xa0When we see a factor that fluctuates similarly to price, we tend to assume that it can be use as a predictor or price movements. While many factors might have obvious correlations, that seldom means that there is a causal relationship between the two. Let take a time in the market in which the prices of gold and Bitcoin are both trending upwards. While the correlation might be useful to make headlines on CNBC or Bloomberg, it might be far from explaining a causal relationship between the two. A very simple explanation could be that higher levels of volatility in US equities is causing investors to move some of their positions to Gold while a deacceleration in the Chinese economy is increasing investments in Bitcoin. If the causal factors change, then the  correlation will disappear.  \\xa0Linear vs. Non-Linear:\\xa0When we think about relationships between price and other factors we visualize them as linear correlations that  together. However, some of the most fascinating patterns in financial asset investments are based polynomial, exponential and many other non-linear representations. For instance, a movement in the price of Bitcoin could be attribute to the expiration of many future contracts a few months down the road and an increase optimism in the guidance of tech companies during earnings season. \\xa0Uni-Factor vs. Multi-Factor:\\xa0We are constantly tempted to find a one-to-one correlation between a given factor and price. However, many price movements can be explained by complex linear and non-linear combinations of different factors that are far from obvious to the human eye. For instance, a price fluctuation in Bitcoin can be a combination of an increase in new investors joining the network and the fact that the price is moving in areas closer to the position of a large number of investors. Now that we understand the types of relationships we can extrapolate between price and other factors, we can start thinking about the type of relevant questions we can ask in order to understand the behavior of a crypto-asset. In our analysis, we believe that most of the relevant questions about crypto-assets can be grouped in five main categories: Financial questions attempt to describe the financial behavior of an asset. Some non-trivial questions in this area: \\xa0Are investors making money or loosing money? \\xa0How up or down are investors in their respective positions? \\xa0Is the number of large transactions increasing or decreasing? \\xa0Is trading happen within new investor or historical investors? \\xa0 Crypto-assets operate in networks which dynamics are incredibly relevant to price movements. Relationships in crypto-networks describe growth patterns as well as unexpected movements of crypto-assets. Some relevant questions in this area: \\xa0How many addresses are capitulating? \\xa0Are new addresses joining the network? \\xa0 Understanding counterparties has been an elusive goal of all financial asset classes but blockchains bring a unique dimension to this problem. For the first time in the history of finance, the behavior of individual investors is recorded in public ledgers. Some relevant questions related to ownership could be: \\xa0Is a crypto-asset over-concentrated? \\xa0Are large investors buying or selling? \\xa0Are minority investors buying or selling? \\xa0Are investors long-term or active-traders? \\xa0 Complementing the previous point, crypto-assets offer a wide canvas to understand the psychology of investors. While we can predict patterns for individual investors, there is enough information to extrapolate relevant trends at the token level. Some interesting question in this area: \\xa0Are token holders overly confident? \\xa0Do they follow trends? \\xa0Are they averse to loss and unlikely to liquidate their positions? \\xa0 Regardless of the non-obvious correlations, crypto-assets are part of the broader financial markets and is influenced by marco-economic factors as other asset classes. Understanding the relationship between crypto-asset and macro-economic factors can generate questions such as the following: \\xa0Is money moving from Chinese equities into Bitcoin? \\xa0Are there visible correlations between micro-cap stocks such as the Rusell 2000 index and crypto-assets. \\xa0 Understanding and predicting the behavior of crypto-assets is a fascinating and data-intensive exercise. As you start digging deeper into the behavior of crypto-assets you will confront a puzzling fact: asking the right questions is more important than getting the right answers.',\n",
       "  'There something inexplicably magical about casinos. Have you ever passed by a neon sign in a big city and stared at the glimmering, effulgent lights shining into the sky? Even though the house always wins (and casinos don even bother to hide that fact), there something piercingly beautiful about them. Nights out in Las Vegas come to mind, Caesar Palace in full swing on a Friday night, crowds of euphoric people, yachts, fireworks reflecting in the waterfalls Anyway, the theory of probability states the chances of you winning big are the same as in a coin toss: 50%. So maybe all it would take is one coin toss but, in that case, would you still place your bet? Online casinos have made it possible for just about anyone to become a part of the miracle Natascha Dow Schull warns categorically against in her brilliant book  by Design: Machine Gambling in Las Vegas. This book should serve as a warning to be very careful when it comes to gambling, but even the millions of dollars poured into making casinos safe by the casinos themselves lately seems to have made the attraction even greater. After all, the adrenaline rush isn as enticing without the danger. But how enticing have casinos been lately? An illustration from casno.org speaks for itself:\\xa0 The truth is, just like all other genius concepts humankind has come up with, casinos owe their success to incredibly well-thought-out mechanics. Casinos can make your head spin in all kinds of ways, but nothing compares to reading a 200-page report dedicated to meticulously crafting the positioning of tables people can get lost in, the strategic removals of clocks in brick-and-mortar casinos, and the stupendous architecture of emergency credit card top-up mechanisms in the online versions. Now, we neither advocate for casinos nor condemn them, and here why: we honestly believe that ultimately 100% of the responsibility for whatever happens to a gamer is in their hands. Approaching casinos responsibly is possible, and they will test one willpower, but so will the world in general.\\xa0 However, if you managed to completely understand the mechanics you could make million-dollar wins happen overnight. The problem with the mechanics of large structures, be it architecture, finances, or elliptic cryptography, is that it immensely complicated, but that makes it even more fascinating, doesn it? In fact, a casino ingenious design doesn mean the house ALWAYS wins; the famous blockbuster  Eleven was based on a true story. The odds can still be on your side. And here how.\\xa0 Casinos work by collecting money from all clients and then giving out some of it to only some of them. That why the house always wins. Most online casinos are already using digital tokens in the same way all of them used to use physical tokens before. In fact, whenever you win (or lose) and the amount is displayed on the screen - you getting a digital version of your token. When you win a large prize in The Game Of Thrones slot machine, what you see is a digital token used to represent the real money you will (theoretically) get when you cash out your winnings. Source: caesars.com That digital version is then exchanged for physical tokens (dollars or other currency). Dollars are also, to an extent, a digital token, since they only represent real assets since the abolition of the gold standard by Nixon and are now only valid so long as the government is happy to exchange them for goods and services, but that a subject for another article.\\xa0 Now online casinos might change that. Some are now using the blockchain to take their transparency and wins to the next level, and the ones that don are left in the same position as the current banks that are faced with the prospect that Facebook Libra may well soon become the biggest bank in the world.\\xa0  you shut up about Libra already?! - An attentive reader will interject, guessing where we going next, but at the risk of your indignation, we go ahead and tell you anyway: what you been told a hundred times this week is highly likely to be correct. Facebook may well become the world biggest bank if it manages to collect as little as $1 from its every user. That just one example of how differently the future could look thanks to the blockchain.\\xa0 On another note, wouldn it be nice to once and for all forget about fraud? Or leave heaps of documents behind? The blockchain can help. It can also solve the problems with geographical access, inability to use banks, and having to wait for days for payments to clear - as well as significantly reducing withdrawal costs thanks to removing multiple parasitic intermediaries.\\xa0 Online casinos use digitized tokens because it makes matters easier, and according to the statistics at the beginning of this article, it working. Digitization as a process offers immeasurable benefits for businesses. For example,  digital means opening up to customers from all over the world and not just the local area.\\xa0 Therefore, it logical that casinos would digitize as much as possible because they want to save their assets (pun not intended). Let take a look at specific examples.\\xa0 Among some of the most forward-thinking casinos that are using blockchain tokens are YOUnited, Edgeless, and Funfair. Crypto tokens used by these blockchain platforms have the same qualities as the digital tokens we talked about before: Source: coindesk.com Instead of  large house edge of 1% - 15% plus deposit/withdrawal fees and 2-3 days withdrawal delays, Edgeless relies on blockchain-powered tokens to massively improve payment effectiveness, resulting in  money transactions without or little fees. Their new structure of payments is reducing the house edge to zero, while the casino main revenue comes from the  luck of the players. They are estimating the average loss as 1.43%, which is a much better amount to pay than 15%.\\xa0 Having a business model based on winning odds can be trusted, unless you providing full transparency.  is no way of knowing what is happening inside the casino servers and how the mechanisms are programmed. It can be easily rigged, as stated in their whitepaper. Since blockchain records offer complete transparency, Edgeless is using Ethereum smart contracts to make it physically (if such a term applies) impossible to cheat, even if someone wanted to, while making sure the mechanisms  each and every time how they are supposed to. A similar mechanism is used by FunFair too, where  gaming session is sent to a secure, transparent escrow on the blockchain rather than a casino account. Would you leave your money with the casino, which is definitely a biased party, or would you rely on programmable smart contracts ( against fraud  against corruption  against honey etc.)? That only possible because all betting funds are transformed into FUN tokens.\\xa0 Getting paid is the number 1 factor that influences gamers to choose a casino, and Funfair Fate Channel smart contracts offer an elegant way to transform current payment systems into next-gen systems in much the same dial-up modems transformed into the flashy Internet we have today. It means no more failed deposits, traditional ID document submission (dreadsome times, we can all still remember sending off our documents and waiting to be approved - or not - for eons), convoluted and terribly expensive payment processes. Both casinos are mainly using the blockchain and tokens for payments and replacing the cash, chips, digital tokens with blockchain-powered tokens. Is this all the blockchain can change for the online casinos? Actually, the blockchain can replace the actual casino (the house) with its smart contracts, as proven by YOUnited. YOUnited Proof-Of-Fairness means the standard clause you would expect from someone who understands the transparency advantages the blockchain offers that are so vital to a casino:  immutability of records will assure that no data is altered, modified or manipulated by any party.\\xa0 YOUnited has the main objective to  the house[ involvement in this industry in order to  real  against players solutions. As all matches go on between players, the house does not want or need to get involved and manipulate the outcomes as before. Not only does 100% of the money come back to the players, but it is also mathematically impossible to cheat:  parties can decrypt the inputs of other participants and obtain the collectively generated random number calculation.\\xa0 In this new case, the usage of UNTD coins boasts a payout system that awards wins in under a minute (which take up to an hour with alternative blockchain casinos and weeks with the traditional ones). The whole ecosystem, from faster payouts and 100% Returns to Players to the most insanely complex peaks of elliptic cryptography, is built specifically with one purpose in mind: to benefit the players first.\\xa0 Finally, should online casinos use a blockchain-powered token? Beyond the shadow of a doubt! With immeasurably better payout speeds, issues of mistrust are done away with with the help of fully transparent systems ready for anyone to check. Not only that, but costs are reduced by an order of magnitude, no more intermediaries, withdrawal fails, casino-intolerant banks, and now not even the house itself is the eternal archnemesis - it all gone!\\xa0 Source: xkcd.com Better yet, the blockchain advantages are legion, but not even 1 percent of its functionality has been fully used, so we confident that even the tremendous pros blockchain-powered tokens offer now will be superseded soon by newer versions that will offer even more grandiose opportunities ready to be used immediately (like players wins).\\xa0 Stay with us. The future is here.\\xa0',\n",
       "  \"Blockchain technology continues to progress at an incredible speed. This great technology behind cryptocurrencies continues to move at the same pace. But we must regret that Bitcoin's blocks, which dominate 60% of the market dominance, are still very slow. These blocks are about 1mb in size and the processing speeds are slow and can now approve a maximum of 7 blocks per second. I mentioned in my previous article that the technology of Bitcoin is very old and the electricity it consumes leads to waste. Although Bitcoin is still the most valuable cryptocurrency, it reminds me of Adam Smith's value paradox, but that's not the subject of our article. Things are not so different in Ethereum, the second most important cryptocurrency after Bitcoin. Sadly, Ethereum has a similar problem  as its co-founder Vitalik Buterin himself admitted. The network has a maximum capacity of 15 transactions per second, and he warned that if the status quo remains, the industry infrastructure will be unable to cope. In summary, what I'm trying to say is that the transfer of crypt currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum should be possible without delay. Because as far as we know, a Bitcoin transfer takes approximately 1 hour, while an Ethereum transfer can take up to 6 minutes. What if these delay issues cannot be solved? As is known, fiat money can be transferred quickly. If cryptocurrencies want to replace fiat currencies, it should first solve this problem. Because investors will not invest more in slow transfers and will leave cryptocurrencies. I would like to emphasize that Bitcoin is the fire of revolution. If it wasn't for him, we would never have reached the point where we came today. I even recommend that you always keep Bitcoin in your portfolio. But if you want to use cryptocurrencies quickly in your daily life, don't choose Bitcoin for it. Before switching to cryptocurrencies, let's take a look at the fastest tool that allows the transfer of fiat money. The first name we see is Visa. Although Pisa says that the Transaction Per Second is 24,000, this figure does not reflect the facts. Visa's TPS rate is around 1.700. Note: Transaction per second (TPS) is the number of transactions executed per second. In other words, it can be calculated based on how many  transactions are executed over a certain duration of the test and then  calculate it for a second. Now let's take a look at the technologies of cryptocurrencies after Bitcoin and Etherum.  *1MB block size *Token limit of 21 million *Slow processing speeds *High energy usage *High transaction fees *No-counterparty assets (value determined by market dynamics) *Decentralised platform Ethereum (ETH) scales poorly even despite a large amount of miners: Currently, its blockchain accommodates around 20 TPS. However, the situation is likely to change once ETH moves from the proof-of-work (PoW) to the proof-of-stake (PoS) algorithm. *Token limit of 18 million per year *Is a decentralised blockchain platform *Specialises in  contracts that facilitate the exchange of value *Coded programmes run without third-party interference *Users must use tokens to perform actions on the blockchain, this forces them to mainly stick to financial actions *In 2016, after a cyberattack that totalled $150 million, it was split into Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC) According to Ripple, XRP, the digital asset used in the company cross-border payment system,  handles 1,500 transactions  per second. Moreover, it allegedly takes just around four seconds for  payments to settle, while XRP can scale up to 50,000 TPS  handle the  same throughput as Visa. However, unlike most other currencies mentioned in this article, Ripple doesn have a blockchain.  For that purpose, the company has its own patented technology: the  Ripple protocol consensus algorithm. Consequently, XRP has been disregarded as a cryptocurrency by part of the community. *Token limit of 100 billion,with XRP owning 60 million tokens *Decentralised exchange on the XRP Ledger *Can create customisable tokens *High processing capacity *Extremely fast transaction settlement speed of four seconds *Uses less energy than Bitcoin, Ether or Visa Claimed TPS capacity: 4.000 (estimated: 50) In July 2018, EOS chief technology officer, Daniel Larimer, tweeted that its cryptocurrency was performing at 2,351 TPS. A few months later, blockchain testing company Whiteblock publishedresults of  first independent benchmark testing of the EOS software. The report showed that with  world conditions of round-trip latency and 0.01 percent packet loss, EOS performance was actually below 50 TPS. *Smart contract platform *User accounts are separated from their private keys *This provides delegated proof of stake *Includes on chain governance *Parallel processing allows users to freeze or modify their applications according to programmable rules *Decentralised operating system *Maximum of 5% annual inflation *Tokens have automatic emission *System is upgradable *Asynchronous communication with other blockchains even if EOS is faster *Fast processing speeds FLETA  has been designed from the very beginning to be extremely fast and have  high security. There are two particular innovations which help FLETA  achieve their incredible throughput: FLETA is determined to be the ideal platform for DApp development. To that end, they have incorporated several exciting innovations and design choices to make sure that their platform is as scalable as possible. The very fact that they can do 15,000 tps and are looking to achieve 20,000 tps realistically should be tantalizing enough for the developersto choose FLETA as their platform of choice. *Has own patented consensus algorithm: Proof of Formula *The processing speed became 1.8 times faster. *Data size got optimally reduced, making the structure more efficient. *They reduced the block size by 43%. *The reduced the size of the index, which is required for operations. *LEVEL Tree Validation. *Block Redesign. SUMMARIZE The following table shows the TPS data for the major projects I mentioned above and the TPS data for other cryptocurrencies. Scalability is one of the biggest obstacles to blockchain technology. But today, 10 years after the invention of Bitcoin, I can say that we have made rapid progress. Many other, newer cryptocurrencies have since attempted to create their own blockchains, which are allegedly faster and cheaper. Their primary goal was often to beat the ultimate crypto nemesis, the centralized global payment system Visa, which can process 1,500 TPS, according to the IBM study conducted back in 2010. Many blockchains have since surpassed that point during their scalability race already. Although cryptocurrencies have long since passed major firms that provide fiat currencies transfer transactions, they still believe there is a long way to go.

       "  'The lack of access to venture capital(VC) is one of the elements contributing to the conservative progress in the security token space. Most VC funds remain uncertain of how value is going to be accrued in the space as well as the regulatory climate. As a result, the early VC rounds in the space have been relatively small compared to other technology trends and only a handful of startups remain well capitalized to face what seems to be a long development in the market. A few months ago, I published\\xa0an analysis about what a potential  A crunch in the security token market\\xa0that causes a lot of the early startups to capitulate and they fail to raise subsequent rounds of financing. My original thesis was solely based on the early VC skepticism and the difficulty of identifying winners in this nascent market. Many signs indicate that we have already entered that series A crunch period and now there is another factor that might accelerate it: the pivot onto security token networks. The initial phase of security tokens was solely based on tokens issued on the Ethereum blockchain. That trend is likely to continue developing but has faced major roadblocks in order to attract support for large institutional capital and asset owners. Alternatively, the market has been slowly gravitating towards the creation of permissioned security token networksthat enable the creation of issuance and exchange of digital securities among a constrained number of parties. Security token networks seem to be one of the most relevant trends in the next phase of security tokens and one that has severe implications on how capital will be allocated in the space. The emergence of security token networks is a manifestation of the constant friction between applications and infrastructure in technology markets. The dual driving forces between infrastructure and applications is one of the regular dynamics in technology markets. Some phases of technology trends are driven by applications which push the boundaries of existing infrastructures until it forces the creation of new infrastructure capabilities. Other phases are dictated by infrastructure investments which will power the next generation of applications. Some tech markets such as cloud computing start as infrastructure driven while others like artificial intelligence begins with a focus on applications. Different markets at different times are governed by different dynamics between infrastructure and applications. It is safe to say that the security token markets started with the strong focus on token issuances(applications) but has been confronted by technological and financial barriers. Those friction points have shifted the focus towards building more sophisticated infrastructures such as security token networks that support more sophisticated issuance and the onboarding of financial institutions. The next phase in the security tokens market seems to be driven by infrastructure and security token network will be at the forefront of it. The thing about security token networks is that they are expensive to build and grow in order to build long lasting network effects. Therefore, the companies embarking in this phase of the market need to be well capitalized to navigate long, painful sales cycles that are more resembling of enterprise sales than crypto-tokens. If security token networks are going to be one of the next big things in digital securities, the next logical question is to identify the potential groups of key players in the space. Based on the current market dynamics, there are different constituencies that are likely to play a significant role in the creation of security token networks: \\xa0Well-Capitalized Security Token Startups:\\xa0Some of the early platforms in the security token space have expressed ambitions to create a new generation of infrastructure based on security token networks. However, the group of security token issuance platforms that are well capitalized to make this transition is a very very very small list. \\xa0Tier 1 Blockchains:\\xa0Non-Ethereum blockchains such as Corda, Tezos or Hyperledger Fabric are likely to launch solutions to support the creation of security token networks. \\xa0Financial Institutions:\\xa0Many financial institutions will participate as nodes in different security token networks but some others will venture into creating their own. \\xa0New Startups:\\xa0The emergence of security token network has the potential to foster the creation of a new generation of infrastructure-focused startups in the digital securities space. \\xa0Libra:\\xa0If Libra get passed the current regulatory uncertainty, it is likely to play a significant role as a network for digital securities.\\xa0This will be the subject of a different article so please hold your hateful comments until thenð\\x9f\\x98\\x89. As a market dynamic, the shift towards security token networks is likely to bring an initial wave of fragmentation into the digital securities market followed by a phase of consolation. Modern technology are typically fragmented at the application layer but rarely at the infrastructure layer. Think about the dominant cloud infrastructures (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Bluemix or mobile operating systems(Android, IOS and your list will be constrained to a handful of players. Both of those markets went thru phases of fragmentation before their infrastructure layer was consolidated. Something similar is likely to happen in the digital securities space. In the next few months, the digital securities market could witness the launch of several security token network initiatives driven by the different groups of participants we discussed in the previous. However, the challenges of growing a security token network together with the length of the sales cycles and the inevitable improvement in public blockchains will drive the market towards a consolidation phase. For startups, remaining competitive during this phase goes beyond technology innovation and requires access to capital. The emergence of security token networks could become a disruptive force for the current generation of security token startups. The transition from issuance platforms to security token networks will not only shift the market attention to a different segments but also the capital allocations. For venture investors, security token networks represent a play in which they can replicate the patterns of growing enterprise software companies. To transition into this new phase, security token startups will need to raise larger funding rounds which have proven to a challenging endeavor thus far. If security token networks become a relevant trend, the digital securities market will start looking closer to an enterprise software market than to the crypto space. The limited capitalization of the current generation of startups means that the transition to security token networks is likely to reshape the entire ecosystem with only a handful of the current platforms staying relevant.',\n",
       "  'After working with crypto and blockchain startups from all over the world, I noticed the huge gap between ICO marketing and IEO marketing. In this article, I would like to share my experience and insights working at\\xa0Guerrilla Buzz with some of the most interesting and innovative blockchain companies to help you plan and execute the best marketing campaign for your IEO. IntroFrom the proverbial ashes of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), which whilst still popular amongst the crypto community, are beginning to fall out of favor with newer crypto investors and certain skeptics of the blockchain community in general, a new form of offering is on the rise. This is mainly due to the perceived risk of investing in an ICO and the chances for fraud, with some reports stating that over 70% of ICOs run during 2017 were fraudulent.\\xa0\\xa0People are also concerned within the cryptocurrency sphere, about the unpredictable volatility of some coin projects. As a direct result of this, Stablecoins have been introduced to the market, these are cryptocurrency coins that maintain price stability. These, however, are not without their flaws and they have had speculation on whether or not they can maintain their own stability.\\xa0\\xa0This new offering is what is known as an Initial Exchange Offering (IEO). In this article, we are going to be explaining all of the key points that you need to know if you are planning to launch your blockchain project to the public using an IEO. A Brief Explanation of IEOsIEOs in simplistic terms are not that much different to ICOs in the way that they operate. Investors are still offered a number of cryptographic tokens in return for the money that they put into the specific IEO project. The main difference between the two types of offers is that rather than the blockchain project itself having to set up the sale process themselves and having to target investors on their own, the sale of the tokens will be assisted and facilitated by a third-party, which is typically a cryptocurrency exchange. As a result of this increase in IEO listing, a large number of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges have started to offer their own launchpad services. These are dedicated platforms that help to market and facilitate the launch of blockchain projects that the exchanges feel are the most likely to be a commercial success. Make Sure You Engage Your AudienceOne of the key things to keep in mind when trying to market your IEO to an outside audience is to make sure that if you do run a marketing campaign, you need to make sure that you are engaging with your target audience. If you are targeting millennials, try and do some research into what things are currently piquing the interest of that demographic and try to implement them into your marketing plan. The importance of running marketing campaigns before you are picked up by an exchange is massive. Competition between various blockchain projects to get onto an exchange launchpad is incredibly fierce and the exchanges will be more likely to side with a project which has already developed a very steady, yet effective marketing presence. You not only looking to engage the investors, but also the exchanges themselves. If you are unsure about running your own marketing operations, do not despair, there are a number of different companies that specialize in running the marketing operations of different blockchain projects. Invest in Making Good PRPR is among the more effective methods of disseminating relevant information about your blockchain project to the crypto community. Furthermore, if you are displaying your expertise in your PR then the community at large are likely to look at your project more favorably and may be more likely to invest into your business at a later date.  One of the most tried and tested methods of generating PR within the crypto world is to write guest posts on a variety of different cryptocurrency news outlets. This does not have to actually be about your project, however, you should be trying to disseminate worthwhile knowledge to the community. You should also be spreading value with your communications. One example for a topic of a guest post would be to explain the problems that your blockchain project is trying to solve and then, in turn, explaining how your project is going to bring that problem to an end.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Making sure that you have good PR is a great way to ensure that when you begin your journey, searching for an exchange to pick you up, you will already have a sizable amount of online content related to you and your project. This online footprint will make you more desirable to exchanges in the long-term. Below are some examples of popular sites used for guest posting:  CryptoSlate  TotalCrypto  KryptoMoney  CryptoRadar  CoinSutra Making Use of Social MediaMarketing yourself and your project over social media is one of the most cost-effective and popular ways of generating interest from masses of people. There are also certain social media sites that have a much larger number of cryptocurrency users than others, some examples of these are Reddit, Medium and Steemit.  Linkedin is also not a bad option. One recommendation for your social media marketing is to start being proactive with it, long before you plan to actually pitch your idea to an exchange. One way of managing this is to keep posting updates relating to your project, this allows you to keep your community interested whilst creating worthwhile content for new readers also. If you are lucky, you may also be able to communicate with people with similar interests and mentalities. If you get cozy with these individuals, they may be able to post about your project, also bringing more viewers to your pages and new potential customers for when you launch your IEO. If you are looking to naturally grow your online audience, one of the most tried and tested methods of doing this is to dive in and start communicating in community discussions. When you are getting into these discussions, it is best to speak factually and to add undeniable value to the conversation. If you come across as intelligent and knowledgable, people are more likely to follow you and therefore will also be more likely to get involved in your blockchain project. Choose an Exchange That Will Get You Maximum EngagementOnce you have effectively marketed your blockchain project and have developed a large online presence, it may be time for you to select an exchange that will host your IEO. One of the first things to consider is that you will want to form a partnership with the largest possible exchange so that you can get the largest amount of exposure and investment possible. Secondly, when launching your IEO, you need to consider whether or not the exchange you are working with has a good reputation in the community. One way to do this is by reviewing news articles about your chosen exchange to make sure they have not been involved in any controversial dealings. Also, get involved by engaging in conversations with different exchanges. From doing this, you will be able to get an idea of how you feel about each exchange and whether you believe that the exchange will be able to do well by your project whilst making the right decisions to ensure the security of your investment potential.\\xa0 Below is a comprehensive list of the most popular cryptocurrency exchange launchpads.  Binance Launchpad  Huobi Prime  BW Launchpad  Coineal Launchpad  OKEx Jumpstart  ZBG Launchpad  BGOGO Apollo  BitMax Launchpad  IDAX Foundation  Coinbene  Latoken Launchpad  Kucoin Spotlight  Probit Launchpad  Cobinhood  Bittrex International  Exmarkets Launchpad ConclusionThere are definitely a large number of benefits to launching your blockchain project through an IEO, rather than using an ICO. You are likely to be viewed as more reputable by your potential investors, yet you will not have to go through that much red tape to set up your sale. This is in contrast to scam-heavy and untrusted ICOs and the overly regulated and suffocating red tape of Security Token Offerings. It is also definitely recommended that you enlist the help of a specialist cryptocurrency marketing company to assist you with your pre-launch marketing. This will allow you to have the highest possible access to a large number of different investors even before your chosen exchange markets your project to their masses of users. If you have a good product, have marketed your product effectively and have partnered with a popular and effective exchange then you will be able to make an effective run at raising money for your project. This money will be able to help you succeed in your objectives going forward.',\n",
       "  'Privacy is something we all value, but some value it far more than others. Transacting in cryptocurrency has its inherent advantages, but not all cryptocurrencies are totally private or secure. Let look at Bitcoin for example. Before Bitcoin became mainstream, people were using it on the dark web to buy drugs, guns, organs and just about anything else you could imagine. Unfortunately for those individuals who used Bitcoin for nefarious transactions, the FBI managed to keep an eye on wallets and trace transactions back to real humans  after all, Bitcoin is only pseudo anonymous. In the aftermath of Silk Road, we saw a number of privacy focused cryptocurrency project spring up, giving us the likes of Monero, Dash, NAV Coin and ZCash. While each of these projects have their own merits, there always felt like there was something missing  dApps. Decentralized Applications, or dApps for short, became a thing on the Ethereum network, giving developers the chance to create applications ranging from games to banking platforms built on top of the Ethereum network. However, Ethereum isn a privacy focused network, meaning that every dApp on the network could have its transactions traced back to users and wallets  not an ideal scenario for privacy minded individuals. As it stands, dApps mostly use a non-private cryptocurrency and network to power them.\\xa0 Meanwhile privacy focused cryptocurrencies are simply currencies that rely heavily on centralized organizations to implement integrations for them. Combining the two worlds of dApps and privacy focused cryptocurrencies keeps the user in control by developing a permissionless ecosystem that is cheap and easy to use. To fill that niche, Particl created its own privacy focused blockchain network that allows dApp developers to create truly private dApps. Earlier this week, it celebrated its 2nd birthday, and it kicked off the celebrations with a hard fork that added two features that make the network incredibly private as well as cost effective.\\xa0 Adding RingCT to the Network RingCT isn exactly a new concept. It was first developed for use in the cryptocurrency world by Monero and was added to the Monero mainnet back in January 2017. RingCT works by taking a user transaction and mixing it with a number of other outputs from the blockchain network. These outputs are added together in a way that makes them identical, meaning any one of the outputs could plausibly be the real transaction. Next up, a key image is added to the transaction to prevent users from double spending. The miners on the network have a list of every key image ever used, so if the same one pops up, that transaction is ignored. By building a network that has cryptographically sound privacy mechanisms into every part of the transaction, users can interact with privacy-focused dApps without needing to understand how it works. Simply put, RingCT makes transactions untraceable and unlinkable. As the crypto space moves to a more decentralized model, having a project that is focused on privacy dApps can create an entire private, decentralized economy. Monero has been using RingCT for quite some time now, but it functions slightly differently. Despite being built using the same research that was conducted by Andrew Poelstra and a team of Bitcoin developers, there is a difference in codebase. This means that while the principles remain the same, the RingCT integration had to be built virtually from scratch in order to work on the Bitcoin codebase. Interestingly, Veil uses the exact same Bitcoin codebase implementation of RingCT, but it added it to its mainnet before this project managed to do so. The difference in launch time for the RingCT implementation is down to testing. By rushing the deployment stage, Veil could have overlooked potential bugs in favor of being the first to cross the finish line after forking the code.\\xa0 The Drawback of RingCT dApps While dApps using RingCT is an incredible opportunity to add privacy back into our lives when Libra and the US Government seeks to take it away, there is a risk that it could be used by bad actors. For example, if a terrorist group decides to develop a messaging dApp on a network with RingCT active, then there would be no way for Homeland Security to monitor what they up to. So, while RingCT provides us with an incredible opportunity to recover our privacy and personal lives, it also provides people with the chance to become a bad actor. Some form of filter on the dApp market place, such as human verification of apps, would be a great starting place for any network hosting RingCT dApps. Additionally, by making all transactions completely private and anonymous we open up a can of worms that is illegal shopping on the dark web. The FBI managed to shut Silk Road down thanks to the public nature of Bitcoin transactions. If you remove this public transaction ledger, then you are essentially giving criminals a very easy way to buy and sell goods without fear of ever being caught. It would make tracking these individuals and gangs very difficult, harder than if they used fiat cash.\\xa0 Cutting Costs with Bulletproofs The second upgrade the Particl network got on its 2nd birthday was Bulletproofs. The Bulletproofs integration we seen go live on this network is similar to the Monero integration, but it been reworked significantly owing to the different codebase. When Monero activated Bulletproofs back in October 2018, it managed to cut transaction costs by 96%. Now, in theory Bulletproofs can save 70% over regular range proofs, but this figure can often end up being significantly higher, as we saw with Monero. By adding Bulletproofs, it evident that the team is planning ahead and preempting spammy dApps clogging the network with transactions. In July 2018, we saw rogue dApps spam the Ethereum network, sending gas fees to a fresh all-time high. By implementing Bulletproofs, the issue of rising network fees should never be too much of a problem. Sure, a rogue dApp could hijack the network, meaning your transactions would take a bit longer to go through, but costs would never rise to an unruly level as we saw with Ethereum. Planning for major dApp usage isn easy, and numerous projects have lost a lot of developers over the rules and codebases used to control this excessive traffic. Bulletproofs are Bulletproof When it comes to Bulletproofs, there are virtually no drawbacks from the implementation. Following the implementation of Bulletproofs on Monero, it takes around 26.3 ms to verify a 2-output transaction - in a test environment. Using the old style range proofs on the Monero network would take around 96 ms. That means that Bulletproofs only take around 27% of the time that a regular range proof would take. Developers work on cool solutions like Bulletproofs that take full advantage of the latest technology to make blockchain networks as fast and scalable as possible. While Bulletproofs do make it cheaper for a bad actor to spam the network, it won result in a decrease of anonymity. Sometimes these developers can work absolute magic and create integrations that have virtually no drawbacks.\\xa0 Using Bitcoin Codebase for Ease of End User Development One great thing about projects like Particl is that they trying to make life easy for developers by using the flexible Bitcoin Core codebase. By doing this, not only are the networks able to benefit from Bitcoin stability and security, but it also allows developers to fork products, services and technology development from the Bitcoin developer community and port it to a more private network. In fact, this is the first example of a blockchain network using the Bitcoin codebase to add RingCT.\\xa0 Should this network wish to add anything new to the network that Bitcoin already has some version of, the team can fork the existing code and modify it to suit their needs. Any project running the Bitcoin codebase can take advantage of this incredible feature. This is why any new crypto projects should consider the benefits of using the Bitcoin codebase over any other codebases out there. Looking at it from the other side of the coin, if Bitcoin developers discover any features or adaptations that work well on other projects using the Bitcoin codebase, the developers can easily fork them and implement it. Let say 5 years down the line, Bitcoin decides to add some form of privacy option to transactions. Bitcoin developers could borrow the RingCT integration, tweak it and plug it into the Bitcoin code. As well as making Bitcoin more private, Bitcoin developers could also borrow the Bulletproofs integration to help cut transaction fees  a feature that would be very useful during peak transaction times. Designed to Complement Bitcoin Rather than positioning itself as a direct competitor to Bitcoin, like we seen from a number of blockchain projects, this particular project is focused on complimenting Bitcoin and working alongside it. By building on top of the Bitcoin code, this incredible project is able to leverage what Bitcoin is developing and merge it with top shelf privacy and cost saving solutions like RingCT, Bulletproofs, stealth addresses and confidential transactions. In fact, Andrew Poelstra, Director of Research at Blockstream, and a number of other Bitcoin developers worked hard on the research that was then used by Monero and Particl to develop and implement the Bulletproofs integration. Without this key research, time and dedication from Poelstra and his fellow Bitcoin developers, Bulletproofs wouldn be the way it is today. A report from Quarkslab that covers Bulletproofs goes into great detail about the incredible work carried out by this team.\\xa0 This project is taking the best parts of the Bitcoin network and adding them to a scalable and privacy focused network that allows developers to create powerful dApps. Think along the lines of a network that is the product of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Monero all rolled into one. Privacy is something that a part of our rights as humans, so when you building a dApp, or looking to use a new killer dApp, consider using a blockchain network that is privacy focused.',\n",
       "  'Facebook recently announced their new Libra cryptocurrency, a stablecoin set to launch in 2020 which will initially let users transfer money between Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp applications. However, the larger goal of Libra is to transform the global economy. In conjunction with other companies and partners that make up the Libra Association, including payments companies, technology companies, marketplaces, and venture capitalist firms, Libra has the potential to do just that. Having been involved in the cryptocurrency industry for the last couple of years there is definitely a reason to doubt how decentralized Libra truly is and if it can even be considered a cryptocurrency. However, one thing is certain, given the proposed makeup of Libra it could ultimately replace all current stablecoins, and quickly.\\xa0 Libra is a stablecoin which will let users transfer money between Facebook platforms Messenger and WhatsApp. Users will exchange fiat currency for Libra coins which will be stored on the Calibra wallet. Users will be able to purchase Libra using their fiat currency or at grocery and convenience stores and load Libra onto their digital wallets. A user only needs to verify themselves using a photo ID and they will be able to use Libra to transfer money between Facebook applications as well as pay for products and services offered by other Libra Association members such as Uber or Lyft.  Calibra will initially be a digital wallet for storing Libra but Calibra it will also as a separate company to Facebook which will be dedicated to the Libra currency and their foreway into cryptocurrency. Calibra will become a wave of products and services based around the Libra coin. Users financial data is kept separate from their personal data on Facebook. The separation from Facebook also means that Facebook will not be able to use the data from Libra users for ad targeting or to sell to marketers. While one of the hallmarks of cryptocurrency is the fact that it is decentralized, Libra is in fact very centralized. Facebook has faced issues with user privacy and data leaks in the recent past so there has been skepticism about Libra. However, Libra is not controlled by just Facebook. In fact, Facebook says that you don even need to trust them to trust Libra.\\xa0 The Libra Association, headquartered in Switzerland, is a 28 member group of companies including the likes of Visa, PayPal, Andersen Horowitz, Ebay and others control Libra along with Facebook. While Facebook is the major developer and initiator behind the project, they only have 1 representative and thus 1 vote as part of the Libra council. Each member of the Libra Association paid at least $10M for their membership seat and the voting power on the future of Libra on the council. This council also controls the Libra Reserve where all of the money used to exchange for Libra coins is kept. Libra value as a stablecoin is maintained not just by linking it to the value of the USD or GBP but to a basket of currencies of the most popular fiat currencies including the aforementioned as well as the euro and yen. This way even if one currency loses it value Libra will remain stable. The Libra Association members will then be able to earn interest from money kept in the reserve after operating and technology costs are accounted for. The interest each member of the association will receive will be proportional to the initial investment each made. If Libra proves to be successful and gains widespread adoption, this could yield tremendous amounts for each member.  While Libra is yet to launch, it has the potential to essentially wipe out all other stablecoins currently in existence. There have been dozens of stablecoins launched in the last year but most of the transaction volume has been from Tether (USDT). However, Tether has had its fair share of controversy as well. The Hong Kong-based company behind Tether and Bitfiniex (iFiniex Inc.) was accused by the New York Attorney General office of taking from the dollar reserve to cover funds which went missing. This has put into question whether or not USDT really has the money in the reserve to back up the coins in circulation. Given the vast userbase of Facebook (around 2.4 billion users) and the financial powerhouses associated with Libra, it is unlikely that the Libra Reserve will face similar issues.\\xa0 The purpose behind a stablecoin is to reduce the volatility which is abundant with other cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum. This instability is the reason why cryptocurrencies have not seen wide scale adoption as a payment method in other industries. Stablecoins are tied to value of a fiat currency. In the case of tether, for example, it is tied to the USD. However, despite the dominance of tether or the existence of other stablecoins like TrueUSD and DAI, stablecoins haven quite caught on as a means of paying for everyday items by the average user. Libra by its makeup solves this problem. Payment platforms such as Stripe and PayPal are members of the Libra association. These platforms already allow users to transfer fiat currencies easily. Libra will function more like one of these payment platforms than another cryptocurrency and will also be able to perform these transactions over the blockchain at a faster pace that most current transactions. The introduction of Libra and its ease of use will make widescale adoption easier. As more companies join the Libra association this will also increase the use-cases for Libra among association members. Any stablecoin wishing to compete with Libra will have a lot of work on its hands.  The hype surrounding Libra has been a catalyst which has seen cryptocurrency markets surge again as bitcoin rallied to its highest prices in over a year. Other cryptocurrencies have not managed the same surge as bitcoin but that doesn mean there hasn been renewed interest in the cryptocurrency markets. The attention surrounding Libra has definitely been the cause of this and its likely that this will continue even after the launch of Libra in 2020.While Libra is a stablecoin and won have the price fluctuations associated with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that doesn mean that the other cryptocurrencies will suddenly disappear. In fact, Libra is likely to lead to more widescale adoption. Given Facebook reach and the potential power of Libra, it means that more and more people will begin to learn about cryptocurrencies and the fundamentals behind them, even if they only view them as a speculative device.\\xa0 Libra could also achieve what bitcoin couldn in terms of being a payment method. Transaction speeds are much faster at around 1000/s compared to bitcoin 7/s, meaning the Libra is likely to be better received as a payment method compared to other cryptocurrencies. This could see other cryptocurrencies be fully embraced as an alternative store of value, especially if prices continue to rise.\\xa0 One issue which Libra faces is that it is not truly decentralized but part of a centralized Libra Association. Given the potential reach of Libra considering the platforms involved, some may wonder if this will make Facebook too powerful. Facebook has already had issues with privacy and due to the potential reach of Libra and the power it will bring, congress is looking to slow Libra in its tracks. Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram went down for a few hours on July 3rd and caused the world distress. Imagine what could happen if they controlled a worldwide payment system which was integrated into everything we own. This is definitely something which has been raised in the US Congress and by finance ministers around the world, and they are looking to halt Facebook from moving ahead in the currently unregulated cryptocurrency industry.\\xa0 During the recent hearings regarding the cryptocurrency on July 16 and 17 some of the concerns raised by the United States House of Representatives Financial Services Committee included their Facebook issues with privacy and Russian hackers and enforcement of AML laws.\\xa0 Their concerns center around the fact that Facebook could hold too much power and information given their issues in the past and that Libra could ultimately threaten the power of the US dollar and other fiat currencies, let alone other stablecoins! The announcement of Libra has already had an impact on cryptocurrency markets but we likely to see more twists and turns before it officially launched in 2020. Facebook new stablecoin has the potential to replace all current stablecoins given the large userbase of Facebook and the reach of the other members of the Libra Association. That potential has even seen US lawmakers worry about the impact Libra could have on the US dollar. One thing is for certain, Libra will leave its mark on the cryptocurrency industry one way or another.\\xa0',\n",
       "  \"Copy trading is often confused with social trading, but they differ largely from each other. In social trading, traders share their trading strategy and price predictions on an online platform. From there, other traders, mostly those who lack enough experience in the trading, pick those strategies and act according to them on their own. However, copy trading automates this whole process. Conventionally, in a copy trading platform, users have access to expert traders trading history and strategies. Upon finding a trader reliable, a user can link a portion of his funds to that trader account. Any position that the expert trader takes thenceforth is copied to the copying trader account, too. The amount that gets invested in the copied trade depends upon two things: the amount put at stake by the copying trader, and the allowed percentage of that amount that can be invested in one trade, as specified in the platform policy. Such platforms are widely used these days in stocks and forex markets. Some of the most well-known platforms include Zulu Trade, eToro, and Darwinex. The latest data suggests that Zulu trade executes a trade of over $800 billion every year.\\xa0 But when we talk about copy trading in the cryptocurrency industry, it still has to gain grounds. The hype around investing in different financial instruments is at its peak, be it stocks, forex, or cryptocurrencies. Of all, the newest concept is that of cryptocurrencies.\\xa0 And despite the excitement around this, a vast majority of the population still chose stocks and forex over cryptocurrencies due to the risk posed by highly volatile prices, which indeed is a grave concern. This crops out the adoption that cryptocurrencies could otherwise gain.  to the latest statistics, only 1% of all users on cryptocurrency exchanges are engaged in active trading. Rest 99% open accounts, buy some kind of cryptocurrency and do not do anything with it as they lack the skills to trade, told Ilnar Fattakhov, the founder and CEO of CoinSharks.io, an upcoming copy trading platform, in one of our recent discussions. Another problem, he noted, was the small size of the cryptocurrency market, which made it subject to manipulation by the large players. This renders technical analyses least reliable at times. New traders, who often don follow a risk management system, are always at the risk of losing their money to such diversions in the market. But, as we all know, there are also those traders who have tremendous experience trading cryptocurrencies, and they understand the market well enough to manage their losses and end up in profits. This creates a huge demand for such platforms that could offer expert trading services to the otherwise dormant cryptocurrency holders. And it would be as simple as just pressing a few buttons on the screen, Fattakhov noted. 1. Reduced risk for new traders As we already discussed, risks associated with high volatility causes the major resistance for investors. But when we replace the conventional trading system, where we trust our own skills and abilities to take trades, by the one where an expert with a proven track record makes all decisions for us, things move to the brighter end. Explaining the same, Fattakhov said: Many have lost considerable sums of money trying to trade on their own due to the lack of understanding of trading skills such as technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and risk management. Therefore, dividing one's funds into several parts and giving their control to several traders using a copy trading platform ensures success and profit.\\xa0 Those copying trades on the platform are also free to change expert traders if they find them non-profitable. 2. Less hassle, more profit, easy learning Trading isn an easy task.\\xa0  takes a lot of time to plan trades and execute them. And not everyone can take time out of their busy schedules to trade cryptocurrencies, let alone the time to learn to trade, said Fattakhov. But that doesn have to mean that they cannot make profits through cryptocurrency trades. With copy trading platforms new traders can now bunk the hassle that is trading and safely test the water of cryptocurrency investing. All they would require is to allocate an amount to be traded along with an expert trader trade and let the platform do the rest. Also, those traders willing to learn and go for the bigger hits can observe the traders they copy and learn through a more practical approach. 3. Wider adoption of cryptocurrencies Reduced risk and ease of earning benefits directly correlates to wider adoption. In 2017, when Bitcoin shot to the moon, it was common for people involved with cryptocurrencies to be warned by their friends and families to be aware of the risks involved with it. But anyway, those who wanted to make profits and knew how to do it, made tremendous amounts of it. Now that people are aware that profit can be made with cryptos, no matter how their prices fluctuate, it would be easy to suppress that fear. Copy trading platforms just add to the ease with which this can be done. Trading experts equals trust. And when people are allowed to trade with the strategies of those who know how to make money, there are more chances that they would join the cryptocurrency bandwagon. 4. Benefits for Experts As is the case for most copy trading platforms, expert traders who allow other traders to copy their trade earn a small commission for doing so. The more credibility traders create for their strategies, the more people will copy their trade. This will allow them to earn extra profits by doing what they do daily. Copy trading platforms have started making it to the market. But as we know, in the initial days of any solution, it isn perfect. There always so much that could be done to improve the services. One such thing to improve in cryptocurrency copy trading platforms is the time lag between the execution of the orders. In a market as volatile as that of cryptocurrency, a short delay could cause a huge loss. This means that the trade for the investors (the ones copying the trades) should be taken in a very short span, if not instantly, after the expert trader finalizes the trade. But this feature currently lacks in the existing copy trading platforms. Contributing his part to the same, Fattakhov explained that most platforms today only allow investors and the expert traders to be a part of the copy trading ecosystem if they are both on the company own trading terminal. However, this reduces the interest of expert traders to be a part of the ecosystem as they already used to their favorite exchanges, and switching from it would be inconvenient for them. Indeed, it can be a huge setback for anyone if they required to switch trading terminals for the sake of allowing their trades to be copied by other traders. This, coupled with all the above-explained requirements and problems, was his inspiration to create CoinSharks so that investors and traders could stay on the exchange platform of their choice, and yet be able to participate in copy trading, Fattakhov stated. The only requirement would be for both traders and investors to connect their accounts to their platform.\\xa0  can manage their account as they did before, and there is no need to somehow interact with our platform, he highlighted. Sounds like a solution, doesn it? As has already been seen in the case of forex and stock markets, there are a large number of people ready to use copy trading platforms, be it for the lack of time or skills or experience. And considering the increasing interest of people in crypto assets, and their inability to quickly and easily get the hang of the market, a reliable and user-friendly copy trading platform in this sphere can go a long way. What are your thoughts about copy trading platforms for cryptocurrencies, or in general? Let us know in the comments below.\",\n",
       "  'Today we will look at some strategies for raising additional investment funds before the main round of an IEO. Toward the end of the article, you find a step-by-step practical guide on how to do a\\xa0Pre-IEO. Initial Exchange Offerings have become the predominant method of decentralized crowdfunding in 2019. However, the average amount raised per IEO has been falling, and many in the crypto world have noticed it. In previous articles we sorted out\\xa0How to launch your IEOand talked about\\xa0Innovative Strategies to Launch an IEO, even touching on the topic of Pre-IEOs briefly in the latter. Now we want to consider it in more detail, discussing why it often makes sense to pursue additional sources of investment to complement an IEO and how a Pre-IEO can help with that. What is a Pre-IEO? A couple of months ago, a Pre-IEO was most often understood as the process of preparing a project for the main IEO round on a marketing campaign, creating excitement and spreading awareness. However, during this process, some projects received offers to buy their tokens in advance, but at a lower price than directly at IEO itself. So what is the essence of a Pre-IEO? The main idea is to take the IEO itself as an information base, and to build an additional fundraising campaign around it as a sort of private ICO. What exactly is needed for this, we will understand further down in the article. First, let understand why investors might be interested in a Pre-ICO to begin with. Why investors are interested in Pre-IEOs The main problem associated with ICOs was that many projects either ended up on very small exchanges without liquidity, or weren listed on exchanges at all. Early investors bought tokens with huge bonuses compared to the price of ICO, but then they weren able to use those tokens in an application nor to trade them and get back some returns. At the same time, having the guarantee of future liquidity means that the bigger the bonus compared to the IEO price, the more money is on the table here and now. As a result, we commonly see a surge in sales of tokens from our customers in the period before the main round of IEO. How to launch Pre-IEO As it became clear from the article, the main driving force behind the private sales round is the IEO itself. Therefore, an agreement with the exchange is important. Depending on the project budget (yes, all exchanges charge an upfront fee for launching IEO), the project chooses an exchange. Often, consultants and advisors who monitor the current market situation have access to exclusive offers from exchanges. Of course, the bigger chosen exchange, the better even with medium-sized exchanges, this strategy works. In general, this should be a combined campaign targeting both the IEO and Pre-IEO. There must be content on social media platforms, activity on the Telegram chat of the project, efforts to get new participants (we have a special package for this called Community Engagement), PR should be widely published, and so on. You can find more details about marketing and PR campaigns for IEOs in the Hacker Noon article I wrote\\xa0here. Crypto Funds At this stage, the project begins to look for investors and make them offers. One of the easiest and most effective ways to do this is to make a list of crypto funds and contact them. Technically, the project does not need its own IEO dashboard transactions can be carried out directly through contracts (mutual agreements). ICO Pools Another way to attract investment in Pre-IEO is ICO Pools. This kind of community was formed during the ICO hype, when many people were gathering together, most often in open and closed chat rooms in Telegram. The pool organizer negotiated with the projects about bonuses and all participants sent ETH, so that projects were collecting a solid amount of investment funds in return for good bonuses. Many pools are now investing in Pre-IEOs and this is a good chance for projects to negotiate with them before the start of IEO. Technically, everything usually happens through pool own smart contract. Participants send investments to it, which are then sent to the project. In return, the project sends tokens to the same contract, which are automatically distributed among the pool members in proportion to each respective investment. Private investors Several approaches are possible to attract private investors the classic search through advertising, to the more effort-intensive method of searching for them in chat rooms and groups. Our experience shows that individuals who want to invest in Pre-IEOs of strong projects tend to appear after several quality publications in the media. Sales with private investors can vary significantly from a technical standpoint. Some projects make dashboards implemented on their websites (like those that were on the ICO), while others work directly on developing a contract with investors. Of course, you shouldn forget about the main round(s) of the IEO either important to keep targeting it in your marketing and PR campaigns. Moreover, receiving lots of early investments and rapidly close in on your hard cap is the best advertisement and hype possible for any IEO. Pre-IEO Main Strategies It probably goes without saying, but any token sale begins with the preparation of the basics, including tokenomics. All rounds and bonuses should be taken into account there. In this regard, there are quite a lot of strategies, but I will quickly mention a few basic things. Bonuses Of course, for a Pre-IEO, there should be higher bonuses than for the IEO itself. This is one of the factors that will attract extra potential investors. Minimum Investment Amount With a bigger bonus, we advise you to have a bigger minimum investment amount on the Pre-IEO as well. A progressive model is possible in which the higher the investment amount is, the bigger the bonus it receives. Lock-Up and Vesting Tokens sold in a Pre-IEO may be frozen for a so-called lock-up period period specified in the smart contract for which part of the tokens cannot be forwarded or sold). This is necessary so that when a project gets listed at the exchange, early investors can immediately sell all their tokens with bonuses, bringing down the token price. But at the same time, it not necessary to tighten too strongly by doing a lock-up for many months. Vesting is also possible explain it simply, you do not send the entire volume of tokens right away, but gradually, for example, at 20% per month for 5 months. But again, the conditions should be both attractive and fair for investors. Conclusion The IEO market is changing and some exchanges are starting to raise less for projects. To the contrary, some projects have managed to generate loads of extra interest even as IEO difficult has increased. Nevertheless, successful cases show that there is still plenty of interest and money in the market. To access it, you just need to work on your strategy.',\n",
       "  'Market making is an activity whereby a trader simultaneously provides liquidity to both buyers and sellers in a financial market. Liquidity is the degree to which an asset can be quickly bought or sold without notably affecting the stability of its price. Market makers  a market by quoting prices to both buy and sell an asset. In this way, the market maker (or liquidity provider) acts as both a buyer and seller of last resort where there would not naturally be another buyer or seller, thereby providing liquidity.\\xa0 Market makers enable financial markets to become more efficient because they reduce price volatility and assist with fair price discovery. This is how it works: For a given asset, the difference between the best bid and the best ask is called the bid-ask spread. Markets that have low liquidity will generally have wide bid-ask spreads in their order books. The size of the spread has a direct influence on the volume traded in the market, with a tighter spread generally resulting in more volume traded. A market maker does nothing more and nothing less than facilitating tight markets by posting tighter spreads. Example 1 is a snapshot of a healthy market with a tight spread on Coinbase pro (BTC/USDC). The spread is 1 cent wide (0.0001%) for BTC, being valued at $11,025. Example 2 is from the OEX exchange (at the time of writing ranked no.10 in reported volume on Coin Market Cap) showing the cross EOS/USDT with a spread that is 62 cents (8%) wide on an asset worth $7.14 (EOS). In addition to the bid-ask spread, another factor in determining an asset liquidity is the order book depth, which is the amount of an asset that can be purchased at a given price level. In the above example, a market participant could buy and sell several thousand dollars of BTC for an insignificant loss (.00001%). Whereas on EOS, if a trader bought and sold just a small amount of the token, they would immediately realize an 8% loss on their investment. If they wanted to buy and sell a few thousand dollars worth of EOS, i.e., going deeper down the order book, the loss would be magnitudes worse. As projects compete for the attention of institutional participants, this is a crucial metric to consider that has serious impact on a project viability. Reducing Friction At present, cryptocurrency markets suffer from a lack of efficiency. This creates a daunting environment for traders to participate in, where friction -- the direct and indirect costs of transacting -- is high. As a result, token issuers suffer, as they need a seller if someone wants to buy, and a buyer if someone wants to sell. In crypto, this isn always the case, especially for lesser-known tokens. Market makers alleviate the friction for individuals wanting to participate in the market, providing well-organized and cost-effective entry points for traders. Facilitating Growth of the Token Ecosystem For the majority of projects, the utility of their token is what drives their business model and future aspirations of adoption. The market maker ensures there is always a potential buyer and seller for the token, supporting healthy token economics and the project future growth. A token economic health, in turn, influences that project standing with key stakeholders in the crypto ecosystem, including exchanges, investors, and backers. Importantly, hiring a market maker to provide liquidity frees up token issuers to focus on building out their technology and driving adoption in the space.\\xa0 Price Discovery & Real Volume The goal of the market maker is to provide liquidity, tighten the spread across trading pairs, and encourage order book volume. Ultimately, volume and exciting projects are what attract traders to an exchange. Unfortunately, many exchanges directly or indirectly endorse  volume to entice projects and investors. The use of a reputable market maker can discourage volume manipulation while encouraging price discovery and order fulfillment. In turn, healthy order books increase investors level of confidence in the exchange, creating trust that is crucial in such a volatile space. Unfortunately, some companies carry out questionable trading strategies under the guise of  making which creates problematic situations for tokens. Market makers with no background in traditional financial products, for example, tend to over-promise and tie token issuers into questionable profit-sharing schemes. Others might promise price or volume targets, which is unethical, not to mention impossible to achieve in an efficient and orderly market. The choice of a market maker, therefore, is a crucial one, with the right partnership delivering lasting benefits to the overall project. There are a few different business models that market makers might employ, each with important considerations for the token issuer: Profit Loss (P/L) Model: Some market makers will attempt to make money off the token bid-ask spread, i.e., buying the token low and selling high. Increasing the spread increases income for the market maker, but reduces turnover (volume traded) for the given asset. The resulting bid-ask spread is larger than if the market making was aiming for maximum liquidity. Retainer Model: In this case, market makers will aim to operate at a flat P/L and focus instead on increasing market turnover by offering tighter bid-ask spreads. The income is not generated from the spread, but rather as a periodic (e.g. monthly) retainer. Profit-Sharing Model: Market makers adopting this model will typically attempt to make income from both the bid-ask spread as well as from a token loan which they trade for profit, often by manipulating the token price. While the gains might be shared, the losses are fully-borne by the token issuer. It should be noted that most reputable exchanges have rules against this type of arrangement, as it works against the retail investor and overall market health.\\xa0 Note: unethical market makers often use wash trading (the act of buying and selling at the same price) to give the impression of increased volumes. The  volume created is intended to falsely entice new investors by raising the token position in volume rankings. Wash trading is an illegal practice in traditional financial markets, and reputable players in the crypto industry are dedicating considerable efforts to uncover and obliterate this unsavoury practice.\\xa0 If you are a token project looking to engage a market maker, here are some basic questions that can help filter out bad actors and help you make a more informed decision:\\xa0\\xa0 Where are they trading from?\\xa0 Market makers should be trading from their own accounts on the exchanges agreed upon with the token issuer. Some may suggest using the token project account on exchanges --\\xa0do not do this. To comply with basic KYC and AML regulations and to prevent wash trading, market makers should operate with their own accounts, otherwise they can leave the project liable for malpractice.\\xa0 What is the funding strategy?\\xa0 Generally, a project will loan a market maker a supply of their tokens. This loan is usually a low-interest loan to be paid back in full after the length of the contract. The market maker will use this loan from their own accounts to  the market Once the contract expires, the market maker will return the number of tokens loaned, not the original dollar value at the start of the contract. Do they do profit sharing?\\xa0 A token project should be wary of profit-sharing services. Some market makers will insist on some type of aggressive profit-sharing model -- this is not market making. This type of strategy that manipulates the market gives no preference to the health and dynamics of the market and has asymmetric outcomes for the token issuer if things go wrong. Its sole purpose is to make money at the expense of the tokens community. What are the KPIs and how will they be reported? A market maker should have KPIs that include the bid-ask spread, percentage their orders are top-of-book (TOB), and order-book depth. A market maker should not be assessed on volume or price targets. If a market maker guarantees a price for an asset it is a clear red flag. In terms of reporting, market makers should strive for a high level of transparency in their trading, outlined in daily communication.\\xa0 Financial markets need to operate efficiently, enabling investors and traders to buy and sell assets seamlessly and cost-effectively. Without market makers, there would be fewer transactions and the overall efficiency of markets would decrease. That is why the practice of market making has been an integral part of traditional market infrastructure, and its influence will continue as long as we trade financial assets.\\xa0 Any institutional-grade market maker will operate with programmatic execution and algorithms that integrate with exchange APIs that are designed to create efficient markets. A robust API allows market makers to act more efficiently with more reliable up-times, providing consistent liquidity. Like many aspects of the cryptocurrency market, standard practices need to improve and bad actors need to be stamped out. By quizzing market making partners on basic aspects such as trading strategy, funding, profit sharing, and KPIs, crypto projects will be able to find a reliable partner that works for them. An efficient market maker encourages a healthy token market, allowing projects to build the future of their digital asset ecosystem.',\n",
       "  'Bitcoin has increased extraordinary notoriety lately. A huge number of Mexican natives have been effectively putting resources into cryptographic money because of the high gainfulness it has offered since its beginning.  Yet, there is as yet a central issue that hangs over each individual in Mexico about putting resources into Bitcoin; \"Bitcoin being legitimate in Mexico?\" Presently, the nation\\'s enactment forces a few limitations to utilize. The Bank of Mexico has expressed that it permits digital forms of money as methods for installment, yet not as lawful delicate. Consequently, Mexicans are permitted to make exchanges in Bitcoin.  The Bank of Mexico is the fundamental establishment that approves virtual resources that can work in the nation and every client would be compelled to confirm that the cash moved to digital currency does not have an unlawful source. The Mexican government is making speedy steps to present cryptographic money explicit guidelines, probably to fuel monetary development and to set its situation as a huge player in the crypto advertise.  Under the particulars of \"General Provisions on activities identified with electronic installment reserves,\" digital money trades and related stockpiling suppliers can give fiat liquidity to all clients, ensured by the Bank of Mexico (Banxico), when a grant is issued. To guarantee procure a license, a computerized cash business must pursue a short method to demonstrate its authenticity and business structure. Initial, an organization must give a definite field-tested strategy to Banxico a portrayal of tasks, staff jobs and exercises, commissions charged-per-exchange and system for a Know-Your-Customer command. The bank won\\'t give liquidity to clients around the same time of opening trade records to counteract illegal tax avoidance and other unlawful exercises.  Amero-Isatek will open its first physical-digital money trade in Nuevo LeÃ³n, Monterrey, on June 21, some portion of an arrangement to venture into another seven areas crosswise over Mexico.  The organization evaluates that it will serve more than 800,000 digital money clients in focal Mexico. Clients of the trade will exchange Amero, Amero-Isatek\\'s own crypto resource, which is booked to dispatch upon the arrival of the Nuevo LeÃ³n opening. The dispatch of physical trades circumnavigates Mexico\\'s beginning fintech laws, which express that new foundation can work in physical areas under a \"sandbox\" administrative plan.  Jimenez said in a meeting that the organization wants to have the option to conform to Bank of Mexico (Banxico) and universal guidelines. The organization will likewise gain two authorized Estonian crypto trades, Invest Global and Global XVC, to complete money-related activities.  Another driver is that Mexico is an incredible nation to begin a tech business. Visas are anything but difficult to get and, with Trump discussing a divider and closing down numerous US visa programs, Fintech firms are moving to Mexico. While Trump\\'s talk is moving to produce back to the US, it\\'s pushing Fintech out and into Mexico.',\n",

       "  'Disclosure: This article is sponsored by Syscoin to sustain my blockchain innovation series. I\\'m not part of Syscoin or hold/receive any Syscoin tokens. This article is part of my blockchain innovation series where I try to spot interesting technology that might impact the further development of blockchain. Today innovation talks about a directed acyclic graph (DAG) technology and how Syscoin gave a twist to this concept with their Z-DAG implementation. If we simplify how blockchain works, we can compare it with a staircase. Each block you add is a new level on top of your staircase. So, your staircase grows vertically in a single direction. Staircase levels are stacked one at the time. This guarantees that the same transactions are recorded across all nodes in the network. In case a node decides to propose a malicious block or malicious transactions, your staircase would violate the  rules defined for building staircases. On the other side, a DAG can be compared with a tree which grows in several separate branches. Transactions are processed in a network of interlocking branches that grow outwards in multiple directions.\\xa0 The validation in a DAG is also quite different from a standard blockchain. Each newly added transaction to a branch is responsible for validating two previous transactions (depends on the protocol definition). If the transaction does not follow this guideline, it is impossible to be valid itself. It might sound like a weak requirement to only validate the two previous transactions. However, by validating the two previous transactions you are actually validating a whole branch of transactions connected to this last transaction. Source image: A simple DAG by Vasa Due to this division in branches, a DAG is able to confirm transactions much faster reaching very high speeds. I not gonna mention exact numbers as a lot of projects claim to have reached very high transaction throughput (TPS). But one thing is for sure, a DAG allows mostly for a higher TPS than regular blockchain technology. In short, a DAG is a very promising technology that allows for a higher TPS to be reached. It has an interesting structure similar to a tree where every transaction has to verify two prior transactions. In case you want to learn more about DAG technology, fellow writer Vasa wrote an amazing post going deeper into the DAG variations and its properties. Now we know what a DAG is, let explore what kind of beast Syscoin has built, naming it Z-DAG.\\xa0 According to Whiteblock CEO Zak Cole,  Z-DAG protocol is extremely innovative and presents a practical solution for many of the performance issues that are currently bottlenecking the continued scalability of blockchain systems. Let find out what is true about this statement! Zero-Confirmation Directed Acyclic Graph (Z-DAG) is a probabilistic transaction scheme that allows for one to separate micro/macro transactions with different security domain tradeoffs in exchange for convenience. Whereas Bitcoin applies PoW scheme on top of every micro or macro transaction, Z-DAG allows an interactive protocol for merchants to decide. Every merchant can accept or decline a Z-DAG transaction based on their preference. Every Z-DAG transaction that has entered the mempool and has some type of probabilities that it will get mined in the future since balances are tracked in real-time and not upon PoW. Upon PoW, however, the state is removed and reproduced based on the block. Because balances are updated in real-time based on transactions in mempool, it is a probabilistic model so the ultimate truth will be what the miners put into the block and what the block of transactions that has Proof of Work on it has in terms of which transactions get mined. Once miners mine a block, the state is replayed based on the state of the previous block. Thus, the probability model around Z-DAG settlement is the likelihood that transactions in the mempool and their balances accurately reflect the truth once miners create and forward blocks to the network. The balances have a high probability of being the same as when they first entered the mempool and settled via ZDAG. This means PoW is ultimately the partition tolerance in the system and the idea is that the view of the network and view of the miner is essentially the same after X seconds where X can be a reasonable amount of time before a transaction is propagated across the network. For now, they have chosen for 10 seconds for the reference client but it can come down as networks are exponentially increasing in efficiency and this can organically be tending towards 0. Source: Syscoin website Whiteblock Regular DAG protocols do not rely on Proof-of-Work. These protocols include uncles or historical information to keep the graph from dissolving. There is typically no longest-chain-rule with DAGs as it is based on the probability that transactions are ordered based on the historical information provided. However, that comes with some problems. There is little to no partition tolerance which is why there is sometimes central or authoritative models to ensure the DAG doesn steer off course (referring to IOTA). With Z-DAG, the partition tolerance is around every block. For every block, the balances are set based on validating each transaction in a block. Therefore, the DAG cannot dissolve as it is only based on what happens within a block. This serves the purpose for a micro-transaction layer 0 solution on top of Proof-of-Work, ultimately settling transactions just like Bitcoin. So, how does this tie back to a DAG? A DAG is a natural construction of transactions with dependencies on balances for dependability. In Bitcoin this dependence is affected after a block, in Syscoin it is affected upon mempool inclusion on every node.\\xa0 It is important to note that Satoshi wrote about a snack machine example where about 3 seconds is needed to detect a double spend. In the Syscoin implementation, they increased this time slot to 10 seconds but the real-time balances are adjusted and one can spend in a chain of transactions based on their balances, creating a natural DAG that is resolved every block.\\xa0 In Syscoin v3, they enforced the order of the DAG by doing topology sort and circuit detections. However, in Syscoin v3, this is not really needed because balances are strictly enforced and clients will not allow invalid transactions to be created in a block that would overflow a balance. Let take a look at some technical implementations Syscoin has implemented to improve the transaction speed of the overall network. First of all, whenever a node receives a newly broadcasted transaction, it will relay the transaction to other nodes before validating it. This means that also potentially invalid transactions are broadcasted to the rest of the network. However, this approach allows for more transactions to be validated quicker. A couple of invalid transactions have minimal impact on the overall throughput of the network. This multithreaded approach greatly reduces the time it takes for signatures to be verified. How to Prevent for Double Spends?Users choose the time they want to wait and as they wait longer and check the status of their transactions, it is more likely they will detect and not complete the transaction with the buyer in a point of sale application. Syscoin recommends that 10 seconds is a good amount of time to wait for a transaction to arrive at your node before checking if it\\'s valid. Of course, it\\'s up to the merchant as it an interactive protocol.\\xa0 Also, balances are tracked throughout the system to detect two spends that overflow the balance. If this occurs, the sender will be flagged and the receiver will be able to see something went wrong. Syscoin has a protocol in place that will flag a signature as invalid whenever the signature validation check fails in the multithreaded verification process. This flag causes the network to switch back to a single threaded mode in order for other nodes to not waste valuable time and resources on validating an invalid transaction. Syscoin whitepaper explains that a master node can scale to 700 transactions per second (TPS) on average. This number is calculated with latency effects taken into account. However, when 100 of these master nodes are active, the whitepaper talks about a possible TPS of 70k. I questioned them about this statement to find out how this works. Jag Sidhu, the Lead Core Developer and co-founder, explained to me how this scaling works.  would be a sub-linear increase in efficiency as more nodes enter and an exponential decrease in the effect of latent nodes on the overall functioning of ZDAG on the network. As more paths open up, latent nodes will trail messages where with fewer nodes, higher risk of depending on a latent node for information. Any DAG project is considered to be a competitor for Syscoin. Let\\'s take a look at the competition. Nano Nano is also able to reach very high transaction speed as they leverage DAG technology. Nano has developed a new piece of technology called block-lattice that allows them to leverage DAG technology but still work like a traditional blockchain.  Nano works with nodes that all act as an individual wallet or chain. Only the node owner can make changes to these individual chains which means they can be updated asynchronously. Byteball is one of the older projects in the blockchain space. Unlike Nano, transactions are not free on the Byteball chain. However, Byteball offers the feature of having fully private and untraceable transactions. IOTA is also one of the first DAG projects, or more know as Tangle. A new transaction can be added to the network if you first verify the two previous transactions (actually building the tangle). This means that they offer instant transactions which are zero fee. The main idea for IOTA is to build a DLT infrastructure for machine to machine payments, enabling economy 4.0 where smart machines communicate with each other and create a whole economy by itself. IOTA allows for micro transactions and can handle a high throughput. Hedera Hashgraph might be an odd one in the list as it is a patented technology. You can buy licenses to use the software.  Hedera also uses DAG technology and gained attention with their gossip about gossip protocol. As this is too complex to explain for this article, you can find a podcast here. In general, many DAG projects have proven that they can handle very high transaction amounts. Often, much higher than a traditional blockchain. However, DAG technology is still in its infancy and there are still many questions about its performance and how decentralised they actually are. Specifically to Syscoin, whenever a node receives a newly broadcasted transaction, it will relay the transaction to other nodes before validating it. This means that also potentially invalid transactions are broadcasted to the rest of the network. It is not sure how this can impact the network if high volumes of invalid transactions are broadcasted to the network. Also, Syscoin waits 10 seconds for a transaction to arrive before checking its validity. It would be nice if they could provide some more quantitive arguments to back up this \"10 seconds rule\". In short, I feel that the Syscoin network should be stress-tested a bit more to really figure out how well their protocol works. Let\\'s hope for the best! DAG technology has shown some great potential in many projects like Nano, Byteball, and now Syscoin. It mostly allows for a higher transaction throughput than a regular blockchain project.\\xa0 In short about Syscoin, it holds some innovative technical approaches to increase their transaction throughput. The most interesting one is the parallel signature validation. Let see how this innovative approach entangles itself in the future.',\n",

       "  'By Geoff Roberts When I signed on to join the team at Qualified last month, I ran the company through the diligence process that I use to assess opportunities at technology start-ups. Great product? Check. Strong growth trajectory? Check. Awesome customers? Check. A team I\\'m excited to be a part of? Check. But beyond this list of important criteria my decision came down to a feeling that I couldn shake that my intuition told me was worth listening to above all else. In 10 years of working with high growth technology start-ups, I never come across a company that\\xa0too good\\xa0at hiring software developers.\\xa0Everybody\\xa0struggles with finding great software engineers. I sat in countless board meetings, leadership off-sites, and all-hands gathering where the story is largely the same had 10+ open job reqs for development positions at the beginning of the year. We filled three. One hire didn work out. Queue the thumb-twiddling and downward glances. Expensive employee referral programs ensue. Contracted recruiters come in to help. But all the subsequent efforts aside the common denominator is clear a shortage of software engineering talent and companies need to find better ways to identify, attract, and retain developers. When I looked at the opportunity at Qualified the marketer in me saw a very real pain point and a market opportunity worth attacking; followed shortly thereafter by a lot of controversy surrounding the tools that are available to help companies assess software engineers. Any Google search or discussion with software engineers about the developer hiring process quickly surfaces a myriad of opinions on how coding skills tests are used in the recruiting process. You find lengthy debates on this topic in\\xa0HackerNews threads\\xa0as well as not-so-subtle articles with titles like\\xa0Why Coding Tests Are A Bad Interview Technique. At first blush these sentiments should have deterred me from joining a company that makes a developer assessment platform, right? But I saw that the market for these products is exploding and I decided to dig in process that began by asking my former boss Dimitris Georgakopulous, Co-founder of\\xa0Buildium\\xa0and\\xa0Outseta, for his take on coding skills tests.  absolutely a market and need for tools like this, Dimitris said.  simply can assess and hire developers without asking them to write some actual code.  Joel Spolsky, CEO of Stack Overflow and Co-founder of Trello, provided further backing of this perspective with a simple analogy.  you hire a magician without asking them to show you some magic tricks? Of course not. Would you hire a caterer for your wedding without tasting their food? I doubt it. Do whatever you want during interviews, but make the candidate write some code,\" writes Spolsky.  Encouraged by this feedback, I turned the question on the development team at Qualified. \\xa0do so many developers dislike coding skills tests? Their answers surprised (and built credibility with) me.  heard the complaint that interview tests are awful, pointless, and demeaning a lot especially on social media, said Phil DeJarnett, a Senior Front-End Developer at Qualified.  frustrating at best because it\\'s clear that developers are looking at it from an (understandably) selfish perspective.  a good developer, why do I need to prove this to somebody I don\\'t even know?\\'\"  Jake Hoffner, Qualified Co-founder and CTO, took it one step further.  a senior developer I be hesitant to take most coding assessments if I was looking for a new job, Hoffner says.  feel like I built products and have a professional network that should preclude me from needing to do that.  Prior to Co-founding Qualified Jake built\\xa0Codewars definitely a person that I describe as a  developer. But coming from a guy that now spending his professional life building a developer assessment platform, I was taken aback by hearing this level of empathy for the anti-coding tests sentiment.  this guy doing building a developer assessment platform then? I wondered to myself. I spent the last few weeks talking to HR and engineering leaders to dig into this question in the greatest amount of depth possible. I since resurfaced with strong conviction and evidence that there are companies using coding skills assessments in not only a developer friendly manner, but also in a way that directly leads to them finding and hiring the type of developers that immediately begin delivering on-the-job. In fact, if wielded properly coding skills assessments can even help companies build credibility and excitement with developers throughout the hiring process. This is yet another aspect of your employer brand that can be optimized perhaps the one that speaks most directly to what it like to work on your company engineering team.  Shane Shown, a Talent Acquisition expert who has built engineering teams at companies like Facebook and Zillow,\\xa0says it best.  a candidate does run into an interview that represents real-world problems that would need to be solved in the day-to-day of the actual position it MIND-BLOWING. I have had candidates leave an interview with a coding assignment that they were actually excited to complete, because they felt like they would understand the company problem and add real value.  This post will teach you how you can move beyond the negative sentiments and turn your company use of coding assessments into a strategic advantage. But let start by reviewing some of the reasons developers dislike coding assessments in the first place. While developers have expressed disdain for coding assessments for a wide variety of reasons, almost all of them can be overcome. These sentiments almost always come from coding skills tests being used as a blunt instrument to pre-screen developer candidates out of the recruiting funnel. Here how your company can intelligently apply coding assessments to flip the script and turn hiring developers into a competitive advantage. The most common credible that coding skills tests get a bad rap is that the vast majority of assessments test algorithmic skills rather than actual programming ability. The tests represent a computer science problem that has little to do with assessing an engineer ability to deliver the work they actually find themselves doing on a day-to-day basis. Glen McCallum, a Senior Software Engineer at INscribe Digital, draws a wonderful analogy between coding and music in his article\\xa0Why Code Challenges Are Bad Practice For Hiring Senior Developerspublished just last week. Testing algorithmic skills is a technical exercise akin to learning to play scales in music. While playing scales is important when you learning music, it has almost nothing to do with working as a jazz musician.  week I was working on a Hackerrank problem for fun, writes McCallum.  had to pull out my old text book for data structures and algorithms in order to code up a merge sort from scratch. I felt inadequate, sent a tweet, and then a light bulb turned on in my head.   all studied these algorithms in undergraduate computer science classes. But as you gain a lot of professional experience you learn how and when to apply them, then you refresh your memory as needed. I knew exactly what merge sort was for and I knew exactly where to find the reference algorithm. I just didn have the details in my head at that moment.  McCallum continues building his point by returning to his music analogy.  it make you a better professional musician if you can play all scales perfectly at any time? Absolutely not! In fact I argue that you wasting precious practice time. How silly would it be if you asked a professional musician with a history of outstanding performances to sit down at an audition and play a scale? It insulting. Then dismiss them before they even perform because they didn do the scale perfectly. The thought makes me sick to my stomach. But in 2019 it happens every day to senior developers applying for jobs.  Luckily, there are developers out there who have been heavily involved in the hiring process that also understand the objectives of their friends in HR and the importance of pre-screening candidates.  enough programmers in the world who aren\\'t really skilled enough for the job (whatever that job may be) that it becomes necessary to offer some kind of litmus test that a potential job-seeker must pass,\" writes Ted Neward, a Guest Lecturer on development at the University of Washington iSchool.  get that and it\\'s not like all the programming tests in the world are created equal. But the ones where the challenge is to implement some algorithmic doodad or other?\\xa0Shudder.\"  How to address the  assessments test only algorithmic skills challenge\\xa0Most coding assessments are built as generic STDIN/STDOUT tests. Instead of leveraging these tools, look for coding assessments based on unit tests write unit tests on a daily basis. Also look for assessments that use language specific frameworks the same languages that candidates would be writing code in if hired at your company. Testing for the nuances of each specific language helps to better surface candidates who will deliver clean code on-the-job. Another reason that coding skills assessments are often bad mouthed is simply because they can be time consuming to complete.  biggest pet peeve with these types of tests is this: there are a lot of companies out there, and I sending out resumes to each one that I can find, says Brandon Savage, Owner at Tailwinds.  simply do not have the time to write fifteen code samples a day, just because you want to evaluate me against your coding test. Period.  How to address the  tests are too time consuming challenge\\xa0While Savage has a point, this objection is far easier to overcome. From the perspective of the hiring company, all it takes is a little self-awareness and empathy for the applicant it a point to be mindful and respectful of each applicants time. I asked Jake Hoffner, Qualified CTO, what he recommend with this challenge in mind. His answer was simple a first cut at a technical screening exercise, share an assessment that should take no longer than an hour to complete and ideally only 20-30 minutes. For a final stage technical assessment, limit the time commitment of the candidate to two hours.  if they don complete the assessment in two hours ask them to stop at that point, says Hoffner.  learn a lot from what they were able to accomplish in two hours, and you learn even more from talking to them about where they at two hours in and what they do next anyways. From the perspective of the applicant, I also push back on Savage sentiment you find yourself needing to write 15 code samples, you need to reassess your job search strategy. This is indicative of a spray-and-pray strategy where you firing off a large volume of resumes (and are subsequently asked to take a high number of coding tests). Regardless of the position you applying for,\\xa0focus instead on applying for a smaller number of positions\\xa0that you most interested in. This way you can devote significantly more time to each, which almost always yields a higher number of job offers. The focus on algorithmic skills aside, software engineers often cite that coding tests don reflect the actual experience of writing code as you would on-the-job. For example, many coding tests require developers to build something from scratch. While starting from a blank slate is easy, it rare that developers would do this very often once hired often than not the real world, on-the-job experience would instead dictate that you familiarize yourself with an existing code base and learn to contribute to it effectively. How to address the  tests don reflect actual programming challenge\\xa0There are countless generic coding tests out there because they are easy to create. Instead, look for coding assessment tools that give you access to a database of pre-built assessments in a wide variety of languages, scopes, and challenge types that are as similar to your own code base as possible. If you hiring for more senior roles, look for a coding assessment platform that allows you to create and administer your own custom, multi-file assessments that directly reflect the process of contributing to your actual code base. Developers often question the validity of coding skills tests because they asked to perform in an environment that not familiar to them. Understandably, they feel like they not able to put their best foot forward. This complaint is also very legitimate asking Tiger Woods to play the Masters with somebody else golf clubs or asking a violinist to audition by playing the cello. Most developers have an IDE (integrated development environment) that been highly customized for their own personal tastes and preferences in a way that comfortable, familiar, and allows them to write code as efficiently as possible. How could they possibly perform their best when they thrown into an unfamiliar environment that they wouldn actually use if hired anyways? On top of that many coding assessments are either timed or ask developers to perform on-the-spot while others look on contrived circumstances that add to a developer anxiety.  How to address the  tests take developers out of their comfort zone challenge\\xa0This one is simple to address developers operate within the confines of their comfort zone. Doing so will help you get the best read possible on how they actually contribute on-the-job. Look for coding assessment tools that allow developers to customize their IDE, or better yet use their own IDE altogether when completing coding assessments. If you do time restrict assessments, allow developers to work independently then use code playbook tools and pair programming sessions to discuss and expand upon the work they already completed. This will give you a deeper level of insight into their thought process and problem solving ability. Senior developers are sometimes unwilling to complete coding assessments simply because they feel like they shouldn need to prove themselves been working for years and have countless products and code samples they can instead highlight to showcase their abilities. You wouldn try to sign Lebron James by bringing him in for a workout and asking him shoot free throws for the first hour. While there validity to this point with the very best engineers also at least some degree of ego at play here. As someone who has hired a large number of marketers and designers, when I confronted with someone who is not willing to deliver a reasonably scoped test project what I essentially hearing is,  have an ego and I don want this job that badly. I can tell you with certainty that there a lot more risk with a marketer delivering a 90-day growth plan during the interview process than there is with an engineer completing a coding assessment. You being asked to share your own, original thinking and there nothing to keep the company from taking your own ideas and running with them on their own. There inherent risk there and you are being asked to provide value up front. But if you are unwilling to do this, what does it say to the company that looking to hire you? And if you really check your ego at the door and take a look at this from the perspective of the employer, it really not too much to ask. For development jobs the employer is likely committing to paying you well over $100,000, to contributing to your 401k, to bringing on a person that they hope will contribute to their product for a long time to come. The employer is almost always taking on more risk than the applicant in smaller companies. How to address the  shouldn need to prove myself challenge\\xa0Make sure that whatever you are asking of senior developers to do, it actually providing some insight on how they contribute on-the-job make them jump through hoops for the sake of jumping through hoops! If they truly a high quality, senior developer you can spend less time assessing their actual programming ability and more time probing on what they like to work with and how well they incorporate feedback. Create custom, detailed coding assessments to provide a common structure against which to evaluate senior developers, but purposely limit the amount of time they actually spend on assessments. Instead use pair programming sessions or code playback to discuss with senior developers some of the architecture decisions they made or how they might expand a feature further. Rather than using coding problems in isolation, use the assessment as a starting point for a much deeper discussion that gives you insight into how candidates think and what it it would be like to work with them. Finally, there often skepticism or worry about coding skills tests because automated scoring of code can lead to false negatives getting rejected that shouldn necessarily be. Fair enough any coding problem there almost never a single  answer. Consider the great works of literature; if assessed against the strict rules of grammar, almost all of them would fail an automated test. James Joyce\\xa0Ulysses, considered one of the great works of English literature, is filled with fragmented sentences, slang, and words that are made up altogether. Joyce himself would fail to get hired at even the local newspaper if they were using an automated language assessment.  How to address the  of false rejections challenge\\xa0Automated assessments are a prerequisite for hiring developers at any sort of scale and save a company internal employees from spending a massive amount of time reviewing code submissions developer worth their salt will understand and appreciate this. What you can do is look for automated assessments that have been informed, validated, and approved by thousands of other developers already through communities like\\xa0Codewars\\xa0(which forms the basis for all of Qualified assessments). Also look to use a developer assessment platform that provides a full suite of feedback tools beyond automated scoring of assessments for pair programming functionality, code playback, and tools to manually provide and capture feedback on specific segments of code. Developers have voiced many hang-ups with coding skills tests, and many of their criticisms are well founded. But by leveraging the latest technologies in tandem with developer friendly hiring practices, companies can turn their use developer assessment tools into a competitive advantage. Your company use of coding skills assessments represents a very real opportunity to build your employer brand, give candidates a strong initial impression of your engineering team culture, and create a hiring process that developers talk about glowingly (and share with their friends).  a company interviews people is a direct correlation with the quality of talent they attract, says Shane Shown.  What does your developer assessment process say about your company?',\n",
       "  'Getting stuck in a programming problem is a very common thing.  For example, when you are learning to code or a new programming language or face a new problem, you have never solved before.  Doubtless, the best way to approach the problem is first to understand it thoroughly. But the fact is, at some point or the other, you will find yourself frustrated. And that\\'s a part of the coding life-circle: Challenge to solve -> Find a solution -> Get Frustrated -> Try harder and Go crazy -> Take a break -> Moment of Enlightenment -> Solve and Repeat. So I really think it is better to try and deal with frustration than try not to be.  If you are stuck with something, it just probably means that you\\'re overheated trying to think for a solution. Take a break, calm yourselves down. Clear the clutter in your mind and start over by following the next steps to shift from \"Try harder\" mode to \"Moment of Enlightenment\" faster and before going crazy about the problem: First, try fully understand the problem you are solving. A time-tested and adorable way to do this is to use the rubber duck method. Often enough, talking through a problem out loud will lead to a lightbulb moment. If it will not, then explaining the problem to a rubber duck is at least a great way to practice clear communication so that when a colleague gives you a few minutes of their valuable time, you can get right to the point. Another step is posting a question to Stack Overflow. This is the most preferred and favorite method for many developers because, at some point in time, the familiar problem with the same context was already solved a while ago.  Debugging is a matter of reducing uncertainty you know where the bug is and how to fix it or where the solution might be applying to approach the problem, then making the change is (usually) trivial. The most efficient way to reduce uncertainty depends on what you already know. No one knows about everything, and it would be a waste of time to memorize things you do not use that often. So every developer ends up googling on a semi-regular basis. Herewith, it is vital to know what to google. It means, having a good idea of what approach should be taking and what bits of knowledge to look up to get the pertinent information to solve the problem. In a work environment, someone else has may have come across the same problem and can give you useful tips or even the full explanation of how to approach the task. Because engineers are humble in general.  Moreover, the value of programming to a business is the finished product - the faster it gets done, the more profit will be made. Struggling alone might waste not only your time but also money of the company. The best junior programmers are those who never hesitate to reach out to their peers for advice. The best senior programmers are the ones who willingly share their knowledge and mentor their junior colleagues. When learning to code or develop software, websites, or apps, we usually will get stuck with a problem or a bug that refuses to be resolved, no matter what we do.  And if you are looking for tips that might be helpful to find the solution you need and not only about coding, you will find them in my weekly newsletter (+bonus networking cheat sheet). Besides, keep reminding yourself that the great thing about computers, is that they always do \"exactly\" what you tell them to do. So, if they are not doing what you expect them to do, work out what you are telling them to do. Once you know that, you are halfway to solving the problem.',\n",
       "  \"When I graduated with a Computer Science degree at the end of 2012, Ruby on Rails was at its peak popularity with the startup crowd. It seemed like every hot startup was using it. Since I was (and still am) a big fan of startups, I applied to various startups and my first job out of college ended up being at a nine-person company as a Rails programmer. I dove headfirst into Rails and learned how to make web applications quickly. To me, the appeal of Rails was and is simple: Trust the default standards that the framework sets for you, and you be able to quickly create web applications. In my experience, Rails largely fulfills this promise. The default settings are sensible. There aren too many gotchas. Plus, with hosting providers like Heroku, you can deploy your application for the world to see in minutes. Four years after graduating (near the end of 2016), Rails was still popular but Node.js had become the hot new fad for programmers as this graph of Stack Overflow questions shows: I ended up with a job doing Node.js work. It was a good change for me to see how another language and framework could create web applications. I ended up doing Node.js for the next two years. In my opinion, there were/are two ideas that made Node.js popular. First, nonblocking I/O meant that your applications could scale much quicker than frameworks with blocking I/O like Rails. Second, you could write code on both the client and the server in javascript, allowing you to reduce the amount of code you had to write. For the first benefit, Node.js beats Rails easily. There have been many words written online about how well Rails can scale or not, so I not going to continue that debate here. All I want to state is that scaling on Node.js is much easier than on Rails. There are libraries and features to help Rails scale, but by default, Node does scale much better. This shows because not only is Ruby generally a slower language than javascript: But, a Node server can generally process many more requests than a Rails server: Node nonblocking I/O really shines when you have to create real-time applications (like chatrooms). WebSockets on Node scales right out of the box. WebSockets on Rails does not scale easily. Node feels like it was made for real-time applications. Rails was made for synchronous HTTP requests and had real-time functionality added on later. For the second benefit, I didn feel like having javascript on the server and client made much of a difference. Code on the client and code on the server are different. The code you save by using the same language on the server and client is minor at best. One feature that I thought would be easier in Node than in Rails was single-page applications. Instead, I found that wiring up a single page to a backend took a similar amount of work in both. In the end, I say having the same language on the client and server is neither a pro nor a con. So, what the issue with Node? Simply put: Developing a web application on Rails always felt easier and faster than with Node. I have set up several new Node.js projects and I ran into quirky issues every time. The default package system (npm) causes all sorts of issues. I have talked with several programmers with years of Node experience and they all have npm horror stories. The fact that Yarn had to be created as alternative tells you all you need to know. Here's a simple graph showing how much quicker Yarn is than npm: For some reason, programmers who create open-source javascript libraries frequently make major changes. I can count the number of times I run into issues with upgrading packages in Node applications. I pretty sure I run into compatibility issues with Rails less than five times in my career. I run into compatibility issues at least fifteen times in Node. Also, since Node isn a complete framework, there are a lot of important technologies for you to choose from. Do you use MongoDB or PostgreSQL or MySQL as a database? Do you use React or Ember or no front end framework? This is just the tip of the iceberg. I estimate you have to make choices on at least five important technologies in your application. What is worse is that if you choose an unusual combination (which is likely), then you less likely to find Stack Overflow answers to any issues that you might have. For Rails, it felt like I almost always could get a solid Stack Overflow answer to any issue that came up. I felt like I rarely could get a solid Stack Overflow answer for any Node issue that I faced. I can almost guarantee that some programmers will call me out and say that I don understand Node or that I not a good programmer. Even though I not a great programmer, my skill and understanding are beside the point. What I do know is that I was always much more productive in Rails than in Node. Ruby and Rails feel well thought out and simple in a way that javascript and Node never did. As I reflected on my time with both, I can help but cynically feel that the real reason Node is so popular is because the programming world got bored with Rails. It not that I think Node is bad technology. In fact, I think it great when you use it for the right purpose: Creating scalable, real-time web applications. But, if you want to create web applications quickly without too much hassle, I still haven found a better choice than Rails. Even if you have an application that requires a small bit of real-time functionality, I pick Rails over Node. The hassle of adding bits of real-time functionality to Rails would be less than the general hassle of Node. It only if I needed to create an application with a major real-time component that I would use Node (like a Slack clone). I not saying that  and  technology is always better than  and  technology.\\xa0 Instead, choose the technology that will help you to create maintainable software as quickly as possible. That what matters in the end.\",\n",
       "  'I can for the life of me think of an intro, so I going to start with one that I think most people know (even though I didn know until a week ago). When you in GitHub, looking at a file (any text file, any repository), there a little pencil up in the top right. If you click it, you can edit the file. When you done, hit Propose file change and GitHub will fork the repo for you and create a pull request. Isn that wild? It creates the fork for you! No need to fork and pull and change locally and push and create a PR. Not a real\\xa0PR This is great for fixing typos and a somewhat terrible idea for editing code. You not just limited to text in comments and issue descriptions. Did you know you can paste an image straight from the clipboard? When you paste, you see it gets uploaded (to the  no doubt) and becomes the markdown for showing an image. Neat. If you want to write a code block, you can start with three backticks like you learned when you read the Mastering Markdown page GitHub will make an attempt to guess what language you writing. But if you posting a snippet of something like Vue, Typescript or JSX, you can specify that explicitly to get the right highlighting. Note the ```jsx on the first line here:  means the snippet is rendered correctly: (This extends to gists, by the way. If you give a gist the extension of\\xa0.jsx you get JSX syntax highlighting.) Here a list of all the supported syntaxes. Let say you creating a pull request that fixes issue #234. You can put the text  #234 in the description of your PR (or indeed anywhere in any comment on the PR). Then, merging the PR automagically closes that issue. Isn that cool? There more to learn in the help. Have you even wanted to link to a particular comment but couldn work out how? That because you don know how to do it. But those days are behind you my friend, because I am here to tell you that clicking on the date/time next to the name is how you link to a comment. Hey, gaearon got a\\xa0picture! So you want to link to a specific line of code. I get that. Try this: while looking at the file, click the line number next to said code. Whoa, did you see that? The URL was updated with the line number! If you hold down shift and click another line number, SHAZAAM, the URL is updated again and now you highlighted a range of lines. Sharing that URL will link to this file and those lines. But hold on, that pointing to the current branch. What if the file changes? Perhaps a permalink to the file in its current state is what you after. I lazy so I done all of the above in one screenshot: Speaking of URLs Navigating around GitHub using the UI is all well and fine. But sometimes the fastest way to get where you want to be is just to type it in the URL. For example, if I want to jump to a branch that I working on and see the diff with master, I can type /compare/branch-name after my repo name. That will land me on the diff page for that branch: That a diff with master though, if I was working off an integration branch, I type /compare/integration-branch...my-branch For you keyboard short-cutters out there, ctrl+L or cmd+L will jump the cursor up into the URL (in Chrome at least). This with the fact that your browser is going to do auto-complete make it a handy way to jump around between branches. Pro-tip: use the arrow keys to move through Chrome auto-complete suggestions and hit shift+delete to remove an item from history (e.g. once a branch is merged). (I really wonder if those shortcuts would be easier to read if I did them like shift + delete. But technically the  isn part of it, so I don feel comfortable with that. This is what keeps me up at night, Rhonda.) Do you want to see a list of check boxes in your issue? And would you like that to show up as a nifty  of 5 bar when looking at the issue in a list? That great! You can create interactive check boxes with this syntax: That a space and a dash and a space and a left bracket and a space (or an x) and a close bracket and a space and then some words. Then you can actually check/uncheck those boxes! For some reason this seems like technical wizardry to me. You can check the boxes! And it updates the underlying text! What will they think of next. Oh and if you have this issue on a project board, it will show the progress there too: If you don know what I talking about when I say  a project board then you in for a treat further down the page. Like, 2cm further down the page. I always used Jira for big projects. And for solo projects I always used Trello. I quite like both of them. When I learned a few weeks back that GitHub has its own offering, right there on the Projects tab of my repo, I thought I replicate a set of tasks that I already had on the boil in Trello. None of them are\\xa0funny And here the same in a GitHub project: Your eyes adjust to the lack of contrast eventually For the sake of speed I added all of the above as  means they not actual GitHub issues. But the power of managing your tasks in GitHub is that it integrated with the rest of the repository you probably want to add existing issues from the repo to the board. You can click Add Cards up in the top right and find the things you want to add. Here the special search syntax comes in handy, for example, type is:pr is:open and now you can drag any open PRs onto the board, or label:bug if you want to smash some bugs. Or you can convert existing notes to issues. Or lastly, from an existing issue screen, add it to a project in the right pane. It will go into a triage list on that project board so you can decide which column to put it\\xa0in. There a huge (huuuuge) benefit in having your  definition in the same repo as the code that implements that task. It means that years from now you can do a git blame on a line of code and find your way back to the original rationale behind the task that resulted in that code, without needing to go and track it down in Jira/Trello/elsewhere. I been trialling doing all tasks in GitHub instead of Jira for the last three weeks (on a smaller project that is kinda-sorta Kanban style) and I liking it so far. But I can imagine using it on scrum project where I want to do proper estimating and calculate velocity and all that good stuff. The good news is, there are so few  of GitHub Projects that it won take you long to assess if it something you could switch to. So give it a crack, see what you think. FWIW, I have heard of ZenHub and opened it up 10 minutes ago for the first time ever. It effectively extends GitHub so you can estimate your issues and create epics and dependencies. There velocity and burndown charts too; it looks like it might just be the greatest thing on earth. Further reading: GitHub help on Projects. For an unstructured collection of pages like Wikipedia GitHub Wiki offering (which I will henceforth refer to as Gwiki) is great. For a structured collection of pages example, your documentation so much. There is no way to say  page is a child of that page or have nice things like  section and  section buttons. And Hansel and Gretel would be screwed, because there no breadcrumbs. (Side note, have you read that story? It brutal. The two jerk kids murder the poor hungry old woman by burning her to death in her own oven. No doubt leaving her to clean up the mess. I think this is why youths these days are so darn sensitive stories nowadays don contain enough violence.) Moving on take Gwiki for a spin, I entered a few pages from the NodeJS docs as wiki pages, then created a custom sidebar so that I could emulate having some actual structure. The sidebar is there at all times, although it doesn highlight the page you are currently on. Links have to be manually maintained, but over all, I think it would work just fine. Take a look if you feel the need. It not going to compete with something like GitBook (that what the Redux docs use) or a bespoke website. But it a solid 80% and it all right there in your repo. I a fan. My suggestion: if you outgrown a single README.md file and want a few different pages for user guides or more detailed documentation, then your next stop should be a Gwiki. If you start to feel the lack of structure/navigation is holding you back, move on to something else. You may already know that you can use GitHub Pages to host a static site. And if you didn now you do. However this section is specifically about using Jekyll to build out a site. At its very simplest, GitHub Pages + Jekyll will render your README.md in a pretty theme. For example, take a look at my readme page from about-github: If I click the  tab for my site in GitHub, turn on GitHub Pages, and pick a Jekyll theme I will get a Jekyll-themed page:  From this point on I can build out a whole static site based mostly around markdown files that are easily editable, essentially turning GitHub into a CMS. I haven actually used it, but this is how the React and Bootstrap sites are made, so it can be terrible. Note, it requires Ruby to run locally (Windows users will exchange knowing glances and walk in the other direction. macOS users will be like  the problem, where are you going? Ruby is a universal platform! GEMS! (It also worth adding here that  or threatening content or activity is not allowed on GitHub Pages, so you can go hosting your Hansel and Gretel reboot.) The more I looked into GitHub Pages + Jekyll (for this post), the more it seemed like there was something a bit strange about the whole thing. The idea of  all the complexity out of having your own web site is great. But you still need a build setup to work on it locally. And there an awful lot of CLI commands for something so  I just skimmed over the seven pages in the Getting Started section, and I feel like I the only simple thing around here. And I haven even learnt the simple  Matter syntax or the ins and outs of the simple  templating engine yet. I rather just write a website. To be honest I a bit surprised Facebook use this for the React docs when they could probably build their help docs with React and pre-render to static HTML files in under a day. All they would need is some way to consume their existing markdown files as though they were coming from a CMS. I wonder if Let say you have a website with some text in it, but you don want to store that text in the actual HTML markup. Instead, you want to store chunks of text somewhere so they can easily be edited by non-developers. Perhaps with some form of version control. Maybe even a review process. Here my suggestion: use markdown files stored in your repository to hold the text. Then have a component in your front end that fetches those chunks of text and renders them on the page. I a React guy, so here an example of a <Markdown> component that, given the path to some markdown, will fetch, parse and render it as HTML. (I using the marked npm package to parse the markdown into HTML.) That pointing to my example repo that has some markdown files in /text-snippets. (You could also use the GiHub API to get the contents I not sure why you would.) You would use such a component like so: So now GitHub is your CMS, sort of, for whatever chunks of text you want it to house. The above example only fetches the markdown after the component has mounted in the browser. If you want a static site then you want to server-render this. Good news! There nothing stopping you from fetching all the markdown files on the server (coupled with whatever caching strategy works for you). If you go down that road you might want to look at the GitHub API to get a list of all the markdown files in a directory. I used the Octotree Chrome extension for a while now and I recommend it. Not wholeheartedly, but I recommend it nonetheless. It gives you a panel over on the left with a tree view of whatever repo you looking at. From this video I learned about octobox, which so far seems pretty good. It an inbox for your GitHub issues. That all I have to say about that. Speaking of colors, I taken all my screenshots above in the light theme so as not to startle you. But really, everything else I look at is dark themed, why must I endure a pallid GitHub? That a combo of the Stylish Chrome extension (which can apply themes to any website) and the GitHub Dark style. And to complete the look, the dark theme of Chrome DevTools (which is built in, turn it on in settings) and the Atom One Dark Theme for Chrome. This doesn strictly fit anywhere in this post, but it wouldn be right if I didn give a shout-out to Bitbucket. Two years ago I was starting a project and spent half a day assessing which git host was best, and Bitbucket won by a considerable margin. Their code review flow was just so far ahead (this was long before GitHub even had the concept of assigning a reviewer). GitHub has since caught up in the review game, which is great. But sadly I haven had the chance to use Bitbucket in the last year they bounded ahead in some other way. So, I would urge anyone in the position of choosing a git host to check out Bitbucket too. So that it! I hope there were at least three things in here that you didn know already, and also I hope that you have a nice day. Edit: there more tips in the comments; feel free to leave your own favourite. And seriously, I really do hope you have a nice day.',\n",
       "  'The process of preparing for coding interviews is anxiety-inducing for many developers. There\\xa0so much\\xa0material\\xa0to cover, and often much of it feels\\xa0irrelevant\\xa0to what devs are doing in their day jobs, which only adds to the stress. One of the outcomes of this is that it now common for developers to spend weeks combing through hundreds of interview questions on sites like\\xa0LeetCode. One of the most common points of anxiety developers that I talked to have before the interview is:\\xa0Have I solved enough practice questions? Could I have done more? That\\xa0why\\xa0I try to focus on helping\\xa0developers\\xa0grasp the\\xa0underlyingpatterns\\xa0behind each\\xa0question\\xa0 so they don have to worry about solving hundreds of problems and suffer from Leetcode fatigue.\\xa0If you understand the generic patterns, you can\\xa0use them as a template to solve a myriad of other problems with slight variations. Here,\\xa0I laid out the top 14 patterns that can be used to solve any coding interview question,\\xa0as well as how to identify each pattern, and some example questions for each. This just touches the surface  I\\xa0strongly recommend checking out\\xa0Grokking the Coding Interview: Patterns for Coding Questions\\xa0for comprehensive explanations, examples, and coding practice. The following patterns assume that you brushed up on Data Structures. If you haven check out these\\xa0refresher courses on Data Structures. Let get started! 1. Sliding Window The Sliding Window pattern is\\xa0used to perform a required operation on a specific window size of a given array or linked list, such as finding the longest subarray containing all 1s.\\xa0Sliding Windows start from the 1st element and keep shifting right by one element and adjust the length of the window according to the\\xa0problem\\xa0that you are solving. In some cases, the window size remains constant and in other cases the sizes grows or shrinks. Following\\xa0are some ways you can identify that the given problem might require a sliding window: Common problems you use the sliding window pattern with: 2. Two Pointers or Iterators Two Pointers is\\xa0a pattern where two pointers iterate through the data structure in tandem until one or both of the pointers hit a certain condition.Two Pointers is often useful when searching pairs in a sorted array or linked list; for example, when you have to compare each element of an array to its other elements. Two pointers are needed because with just pointer, you would have to continually loop back through the array to find the answer. This back and forth\\xa0with a single iterator is inefficient for time and space complexity  a concept referred to as asymptotic analysis.\\xa0While the brute force or naive solution with 1 pointer would work, it will\\xa0produce something along the lines of O(n In many cases, two pointers can help you find a solution with better space or\\xa0runtime complexity.  Ways to identify when to use the Two Pointer method: Here are some problems that\\xa0feature\\xa0the Two Pointer pattern: 3. Fast and Slow pointersThe Fast and Slow pointer approach, also known as the\\xa0Hare & Tortoise algorithm, is a pointer algorithm that uses two pointers which move through the array (or sequence/linked list)\\xa0at different speeds.\\xa0This approach is quite useful when dealing with cyclic linked lists or arrays. By moving at different speeds (say, in a cyclic linked list), the algorithm proves that the two pointers are bound to meet. The fast pointer should catch the slow pointer once both the pointers are in a cyclic loop.  How do you identify when to use the Fast and Slow pattern? When should I use it over the Two Pointer method mentioned above? Problems featuring the fast and slow pointers pattern: 4. Merge Intervals The Merge Intervals pattern is an efficient technique to deal with overlapping\\xa0intervals. In a lot of problems involving intervals, you either need to find overlapping intervals or merge intervals if they overlap. The pattern works like this: Given two intervals ( and  there will be six different ways the two intervals can relate to each other: Understanding and recognizing these six cases will help you help you solve a wide range of problems from inserting intervals to optimizing interval merges. How do you identify when to use the Merge Intervals pattern? Merge interval problem patterns: 5. Cyclic sort This pattern describes an interesting approach to deal with problems involving arrays containing numbers in a given range.\\xa0The Cyclic Sort pattern iterates over the array one number at a time, and if the current number you are iterating is not at the correct index, you swap it with the number at its correct index.\\xa0You could try placing the number in its correct index, but this will produce a complexity of O(n^2) which is not optimal, hence the Cyclic Sort pattern. How do I identify this pattern? Problems featuring cyclic sort pattern: 6. In-place reversal of linked list In a lot of problems, you may be asked to reverse the links between a set of nodes of a linked list. Often, the constraint is that you need to do this in-place, i.e., using the existing node objects and without using extra memory. This is where the above mentioned pattern is useful. This pattern reverses one node at a time starting with one variable (current) pointing to the head of the linked list, and one variable (previous) will point to the previous node that you have processed. In a lock-step manner, you will reverse the current node by pointing it to the previous before moving on to the next node. Also, you will update the variable  to always point to the previous node that you have processed. How do I identify when to use this pattern: Problems featuring in-place reversal of linked list pattern: 7. Tree BFS This pattern is based on the Breadth First Search (BFS) technique to traverse a tree and uses a queue to keep track of all the nodes of a level before jumping onto the next level. Any problem involving the traversal of a tree in a level-by-level order can be efficiently solved using this approach. The Tree BFS pattern works by pushing the root node to the queue and then continually iterating until the queue is empty. For each iteration, we remove the node at the head of the queue and  that node. After removing each node from the queue, we also insert all of its children into the queue. How to identify the Tree BFS pattern: Problems featuring Tree BFS pattern: 8. Tree DFS Tree DFS is based on the Depth First Search (DFS) technique to traverse a tree. You can use recursion (or a stack for the iterative approach) to keep track of all the previous (parent) nodes while traversing. The Tree DFS pattern works by starting at the root of the tree, if the node is not a leaf you need to do three things: How to identify the Tree DFS pattern: Problems featuring Tree DFS pattern: 9. Two heaps In many problems, we are given a set of elements such that we can divide them into two parts. To solve the problem, we are interested in knowing the smallest element in one part and the biggest element in the other part. This pattern is an efficient approach to solve such problems. This pattern uses two heaps; A Min Heap to find the smallest element and a Max Heap to find the biggest element. The pattern works by storing the first half of numbers in a Max Heap, this is because you want to find the largest number in the first half. You then store the second half of numbers in a Min Heap, as you want to find the smallest number in the second half.\\xa0At any time, the median of the current list of numbers can be calculated from the top element of the two heaps. Ways to identify the Two Heaps pattern: Problems featuring 10. Subsets A huge number of coding interview problems involve dealing with Permutations and Combinations of a given set of elements. The pattern Subsets describes an efficient Breadth First Search (BFS) approach to handle all these problems. The pattern looks like this: Given a set of [1, 5, 3] Here is a visual representation of the Subsets pattern: How to identify the Subsets pattern: Problems featuring Subsets pattern: 11. Modified binary\\xa0search Whenever you are given a sorted array, linked list, or matrix, and are asked to find a certain element, the best algorithm you can use is the Binary Search. This pattern describes an efficient way to handle all problems involving Binary Search. The patterns looks like this for an ascending order set: Here is a visual representation of the Modified Binary Search pattern:  Problems featuring the Modified Binary Search pattern: Order-agnostic Binary Search (easy)Search\\xa0in a Sorted Infinite\\xa0Array\\xa0(medium) 12. Top K elements Any problem that asks us to find the top/smallest/frequent  elements among a given set falls under this pattern. The best data structure to keep track of  elements is Heap. This pattern will make use of the Heap to solve multiple problems dealing with  elements at a time from a set of given elements. The pattern looks like this:  There is no need for a sorting algorithm because the heap will keep track of the elements for you. How to identify the Top  Elements pattern: Problems featuring Top  Elements pattern: 13. K-way Merge K-way Merge helps you solve problems that involve a set of sorted arrays. Whenever you given  sorted arrays, you can use a Heap to efficiently perform a sorted traversal of all the elements of all arrays. You can push the smallest element of each array in a Min Heap to get the overall minimum. After getting the overall minimum, push the next element from the same array to the heap. Then, repeat this process to make a sorted traversal of all elements.  The pattern looks like this: How to identify the K-way\\xa0Merge\\xa0pattern: Problems featuring the K-way Merge pattern: 14. Topological sort Topological Sort is used to find a linear ordering of elements that have dependencies on each other. For example, if event  is dependent on event   comes before  in topological ordering. This pattern defines an easy way to understand the technique for performing topological sorting of a set of elements. The pattern works like this:  How to identify the Topological Sort pattern: Problems featuring the Topological Sort pattern: What next? Experiencing LeetCode fatigue?

       "  'As programmers, we know how important it is to be up to date in terms of programming languages, frameworks, methodologies and tools in general. We must always be in continuous learning. One of the best ways to stay up-to-date is by attending technology conferences and events, but many of these events are not in our city or we simply cannot attend. The positive part is that most of these events are recorded and are available for free through different video platforms (mainly Youtube or Vimeo), which is great, but there are a couple of problems:  There are plenty of interesting events and talks around the world every week and it hard to be aware that they exist.  Each event is on a different date and is published on different accounts and video platforms, which makes it very complicated to track the events that interest us. That why we decided to create Codetalks.tv, a platform for developers that brings together the best programming talks around the world in one place. Each video is grouped by tags and event so that it is incredibly easy to discover conferences, watch lectures and keep learning. Considering that this is a MVP (minimum viable product) we wouldn want to extend the development time too much, therefore, we tried to identify the key functionalities that would give meaning to the project, in this way we could validate if our idea made sense or not before continuing to invest more time and effort in it. The characteristics we identified as most important were: As for the design, it had to be simple and intuitive. It didn make sense to create anything new and extravagant and that why we opted for a design similar to that of Youtube, so that anyone can instantly feel familiar with it.  Focusing more on the look and feel, we decided to make a small wink to our potential users, the developers, for this reason we gave it the appearance of a code editor (VS Code?), and even we used the famous Monokai color palette.  And it time to code! One of the interesting things about a side-project is that you can afford to experiment and try new things out, so, we didn want to miss this opportunity. Here is a brief summary of the technology stack we used, both for the backend and for the frontend. If you find it interesting, we will publish more articles explaining part of the development process in more detail. Frontend: Other libraries or tools that have helped us a lot: Backend: Third party\\xa0tools: And then came the moment of truth\\xa0 The truth is that if we are taken out of the technical or product part we will feel like a fish out of water, one could say that marketing is not our strong point. That why, to define our launch strategy, we simply asked ourselves a question: Where are our potential users?, and based on the answers we found, we drew up a list of possible acquisition channels: \\xa0 Big portals (Disaster): At this point, and after a truly horrible initial release, we wondered if CodeTalks actually made sense, are we really solving a problem and bringing something to the community? our motivation crashed. However, after a few days of decline, we decided to continue trying in other ways and this time, fortunately, it was better:  ï¸\\x8fNiche media (Not\\xa0bad): Despite not having had a spectacular launch, we have seen over the last month how traffic has been increasing day after day steadily. In addition, we have received a lot of positive feedback, so the general feeling is that people like it, and although we think we have not reached product-market-fit yet, we do believe that we are going in the right direction and that it is worth continuing to invest some more time. In addition, we have a few very cool ideas for version 2.0, and why not, we make another release later with lessons learned, maybe this time we be luckier hehehe.

       "  \"From complex databases to self-driving cars, the usage area of C and C++ languages is surprisingly wide. Even today, with a myriad of new & robust programming tools, the two coding languages from 70s cannot be replaced. So what are the common applications of C & C++ today and why we still use them? Let find out in this article. Since C language was originally designed for system level programming, it no surprise that it commonly used to build operating systems and firmware. It close enough to the hardware layer to manipulate low-level code but also fast and energy-efficient. These factors make it a perfect fit for OS development. Above all, any operating system has to run fast and efficiently manage system resources. For example, Linux, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS are all written in C. As well as Android and iOS to some extent. A C developer can implement all the data structures himself, fine-tuning the smallest details of an operating system. Such increased flexibility makes C a commonly preferred option. And unlike other languages, C has no runtime dependencies. This means that a program could run directly on the hardware without requiring a memory manager, input or output layer. C is the de-facto language when it comes to embedded systems engineering. Why so? Mainly due to its high performance and ease of use. C language consumes very few memory resources which makes the program run quickly. As a result, you can expect the embedded systems to perform in real time with no overhead. More so, since C code is highly portable, it is not tied to any specific microprocessor or a system. So you can compile an embedded program across various devices and platforms with little or no change at all. That why autonomous cars, smartwatches, IoT sensors and devices like coffee machines have firmware all written in C or C++. In connected systems, C lets you work directly with the memory resources and adjust every part of the code. So if you're choosing the right technology for your IoT development project, consider these languages. The performance is critical for a game, so the choice of a programming language is limited in this field. Since C++ is the fastest programming language for today, it turns out one of the best choices for 3D, multiplayer or other games. For instance, Counter-Strike, StarCraft: Brood War, Diablo I, World of Warcraft are all written in C++. Not to mention Xbox and PlayStation consoles which are based on C++ programming. The core of Unity game engine also used C++ development. And Unity is the most popular engine for building video games, targetting multiple OS at once. Even the most intensive game graphics can be handled with C++ software development. It lets you optimize and adjust how exactly the game memory resources and data structures will be used. As a result, you have complete control over the game development. C++ can be also used to build desktop applications. All thanks to its superior cross-platform frameworks such as Qt. It allows you to target Windows, Linux, macOS, Android and embedded systems with a single codebase. So the app development with Qt turns out a great option if you want to cut the programming time & costs. Another feature-rich library SDL lets you build for Windows, Linux, Android, MacOS and iOS at the same time. By the way, Photoshop, Illustrator and Adobe Premiere are all written in C++. Facebook converted some of its code from PHP to C++ language to reduce the power consumption per user. Cloud storage systems, databases, device drivers and other types of software might use C++ development. Consider also banking and other apps with high concurrency and low latency support. Or basically, anything that has to run fast with no issues. Taking into account all of the above, we consider C/C++ languages good choices for: For example, in projects dealing with complex data types, software development with C++ prevents data overload or related issues. So if you asking: Here the short answer: C and C++ are flexible, extremely fast and efficient. And they are closer to machine code than any other language. That why, in some cases, these languages simply cannot be replaced. In fact, C is the second language by popularity as it closely follows Java according to Tiobe. Here our prediction: In the near future, C language will not leave the tech arena. Especially since the number of IoT connected devices is growing, and they heavily rely on the machine code and memory manipulation.\\xa0 Are you excited to see what coming?

       "  \"Recently I decided I would like to get a bit more into Ethereum development, as blockchain technology had always interested me but I never got around to actually making a project with it. With Android being my favorite environment, I decided this would be my platform. However, upon starting I noticed it was quite difficult to find much information about Ethereum development in mobile, leading to the creation of this article, where I show you how to make a simple Ethereum application using web3j on the Ethereum Testnet Rinkeby. The first step of working with Web3j in Android is to add it to your project. Since Web3j has a maven plugin, this is very easy: Simply add mavencentral to your project build.gradle file and then add web3j as a dependency to your application build.gradle file (make sure you are using the Android version). Since we be using the internet to interact with the Ethereum network, specify this permission in the android manifest file. When communicating with the Ethereum blockchain, one must do this through a node. Explaining what a node is exactly would be out of the scope of this article, however, what is important about these is that they are used to send and receive information to and from the Ethereum blockchain.Now, to set one of these up on a mobile device, you have the choice of either running a private node on the device or through a node in the cloud, which in our case is supplied by Infura. The reason I decided to use Infura, is that running any node requires it to be in sync with the Ethereum network, meaning upon first initializing such a node it takes a bit of time and a lot of memory (for mobile device standards) to start up, which I was looking to avoid (if you are nevertheless interested in running a private node, I suggest taking a look into go-Ethereum mobile). You can easily sign up for an API key at\\xa0Infura. Once you have, use your endpoint link to create a new Web3j object and connect to the Rinkeby Testnet: If everything went well, you just connected to the Rinkeby Ethereum Testnet. Congratulations!  Let create a wallet so we can send and receive testnet ether next. To do this, we need to create a wallet file inside the user's device: Great, now that we have a wallet, let get its address so we can load it with a bit of Testnet ether from the Rinkeby\\xa0faucet. After having loaded our wallet with some Rinkeby Ether, let try sending it back: And that it! You just created a simple Android app to handle the Ethereum Blockchain capable of sending and receiving Ether. The code for all this can be found\\xa0here. Thanks for following along!\",\n",
       "  'Majority of software developers are aspired to be not only a competent professional but also a great one. Nowadays, with accessibility to many courses online, it not necessary anymore to study to become a great software developer. However, a lot of great programmers went to universities and specialized in computer science. Because getting a degree in CS helps understand architecture better and gives us a holistic perspective on the world of software development in the future. When I look at many programmers, I see that they are always trying to know about new technologies, languages, trends, and so on. I also know that coding knowledge is a must, but it does not mean that we should learn whatever there is on the internet. No one can learn everything. What I have seen in some great professionals is that they are not only well-versed with technical skills, but also business and people skills. They know what business wants and deliver what companies need. They know how to work with others effectively and deliver more than they could done alone. Indeed, there are more ways than one on how to become a great programmer, but the best is probably to become a contributing member of a great programming team. And here there are a few qualities that make for a great software developer: A great programmer cares about the product. They are dedicated, positive, and patient enough to work through the most tedious and challenging problems. They take pride in their code contribution and make it easy to read and understand for other developers in the team. If it necessary, they will step up and not be dissuaded by the challenge, because they care about what they are doing. They don let their ego get in the way of taking feedback. On the contrary, they are awaiting/seeking constructive feedback about their work and their behavior. Excellent communication skills directly correlate with excellent technical skills. A great developer can understand problems clearly, break them down into hypotheses, and propose solutions coherently. They understand concepts quickly, in the way by asking the right questions and then documenting received answers, not only for themselves but also for the team. Also, by being a better communicator, they can leverage the strength and specializations of others and offer their own advantages to the folks around them. It means they are highly reliable and keep in mind deadlines. They know that humans are terrible at predicting the effort and time required to complete a task, but they have become good at it by using techniques, strategies (like Agile points), and tools to help them. The desire to unselfishly share their knowledge and help other developers improve is another superb quality of great developers. They help teammates when they get stuck and take criticism well because they are more interested in team achievement than personal. They teach new skills, contribute to open source, and write documentation that not only helps teammates but the developer community in general. A good programmer does what is asked of them while a great programmer does what is best for the end user of the software. They will recommend building the solution which is best for the end user, even if it a more complicated or difficult opinion. A good programmer is intelligent, while a great programmer is wise. In the same way, a good programmer might know tons of algorithms by heart that they use in their code. A great programmer knows which libraries to use, so they don have to be constantly writing algorithms. A good programmer makes sure every functionality works perfectly before delivering. A great programmer manages the scope of the project so that the key features are delivered within the deadline. A good programmer shows their genius by creating a complex bespoke code. A great programmer solves the problem most simply and efficiently as possible. In fact, the transition from being a good programmer to great one often comes through passion, dedication, practice, understanding, honest efforts, time, and diverse experience. (Ten years of diverse background is much greater than one year repeated ten times). Sometimes they sound and behave a little like business owners. Not like a techno weirdo. They understand their role in the value-added chain and know that they are not only writing code, but they are also providing new value opportunities to users, business, and people around them. The most exceptional programmers are likable and always have time for other developers in the team. There is a lot of things that are behind being a great developer, and I just listed which qualities I find the most important in great software developers. One of my goals is the same as yours: being a great software engineer.

       "  \"Are you a junior developer embarking on your software development career? Or a recent computer science graduate who has recently started a new job? Maybe a self-taught developer wondering what to do next? Starting your software development career can be scary, but also very exciting. I know the feeling, having been there myself. Over the past 4 years, I have gone from junior developer to lead developer at a SaaS startup, learning lots along the way. I have written this guide with my top tips, to not only survive but strive in your first year as a junior developer. University degrees, coding boot camps, and online courses do a great job at teaching you how to code. Yet, the truth is that in the real world of software development there is a bit more to it than writing code. You have to understand: - Which technologies are best for different problems - Code written by other people - Design patterns and best practices - How to test codeCI/CD, source control, and branching strategies - The software development lifecycle and different methodologies - Working not only with your team, but with other teams, management, and clients  name a few things. You may already know some of this stuff, or you may have never heard of any of it before. And that OK. You are there as a junior software developer, your manager and your teammates know this. So there will be gaps in your knowledge. Every developer has them! Don feel overwhelmed if it all doesn make sense straight away. In fact, part of the beauty of being a software developer is that technology is always changing. We will always be learning, regardless of what level we are at. You have your first task, you get excited and dive straight in. But then stuck. Your code doesn work as expected, and all you have to go by is a strange, confusing error message. Stumped, you think about asking one of the other developers on your team for help, but you think:  if they think I dumb? or that I can code? and laugh at me?! But in reality, that will never happen. What they will actually think is:  I take a quick look and see if I can help. Ah! Yes, I encountered this issue before, you can use someMethod() from somePackage() to fix it. Which isn so bad right? Your team is there to support you, especially in the early parts of your career, so ask them for help (if you're interested, I go into a bit more detail about how to be a good teammate here). Likewise, if you don understand something, ask questions. I still asking loads of questions every day! There is no such thing as a stupid question. Your team would rather help you instead of having you stare at your screen with confusion for most of the day. I never forget my first code review as part of my first junior developer job. My code was being reviewed by an experienced senior developer. At the time I found this nerve-wracking. And, of course, there were more comments from him than I could count! But in hindsight, this was a good thing. Code reviews are not a stage for criticism, but for learning and giving feedback on all sides. The senior developer sat down with me and explained what each of the comments meant, and also why he had made them. Needless to say, I learned a lot. So when your code is being reviewed, remember that any feedback is to help you learn and improve as a software developer. Likewise, when you come to review code for other people, you will be able to see how different people approach different problems. You will even help them improve by making suggestions of your own! Break it down, and break it down some more Ok so you have your first real task, depending on the size of the task, you might feel a bit overwhelmed:  do I start? I guess I start with doing X, but what about Y? But then if I do Y there A, B, and C happening with X again?! Don worry we all been there. It easy to get lost in the proverbial rabbit hole when trying to solve a problem. The next time you have a large problem to solve, try remembering this quote, In other words, make a task which seems impossible more manageable by breaking it up into smaller tasks. So how do you do that? Before writing any code, try writing out the steps in plain English (or language of your choice). Let take an example. How do you pour a glass of water? A plain English approach would be - Open the cupboard - Get a glass - Place glass under the tap - Turn on the tap - When the glass is full, turn off the tap - Remove glass from under the tap By writing out the steps, it is easier to visualize each part of the problem and come up with a solution for each step. A common mistake many junior developers make (myself included when I started) is to try and reinvent the wheel. It might look impressive to solve a problem by using a super-fancy technique within your code. But this causes other problems: Code that is completely different from how similar parts of the system work is harder to maintainYour code may become more verbose that it needs to be, and there will be an increased risk of bugsIt may take you longer to complete your task So how exactly do you keep it simple? Make it work. Don overthink too much, and do whatever your gut says to get your code working Refactor. Now that your code is working, it time to refactor. Make your code easy to read by naming things well, and use of proper formatting. More on this in  how to write clean code below Speed it up. Once you have finished refactoring, you might notice bottlenecks in the performance of your code. Now is the time to optimize it. Be wary not to fall into the trap of over-optimizing too early! Only do this if you need to. BONUS TIP. Consider writing some failing tests before writing any code. This is called Test Driven Development. Not only will this give you good test coverage, but it will help you think about the structure of your code. Mastering clean code will make you stand out as a software developer. So what exactly do we mean by Clean Code? Follows the S.O.L.I.D principlesIt is testable and maintainableIt is easy to read and follow In other words: I won go into too much detail here, like the book, Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship by Robert C Martin will give a much deeper insight into this area. If you are serious about writing clean code and breaking out of the junior developer level, I highly recommend this book. Writing clean code shows that you are passionate about what you do, and can create maintainable reliable software. Not to mention that you will be making life a bit easier for the next person who comes along to add to your code. Have you ever told a friend about a problem you were having, and they respond with  there an app for that Software development is a bit like this. There are already a lot of answers to the problems you are trying to solve. So when you are trying to complete a task, check to see if someone else has already solved the problem. You can do this by: Looking for existing packages and librariesBrowsing sites such as GitHub and StackOverflow for similar solutions to your problem. Hold it right there! This doesn give you free rein to copy and paste code without a thought. If you are using someone else code as an example, it is important that you understand what their code is doing and why. Why is it using a particular design pattern?Why is it written in a particular language? (Node.js vs Python for example)What are the drawbacks? Will it work with your current codebase? If you not sure, you can ask someone on your team for some guidance. Searching Google for an answer is a common approach to solving coding tasks. So don be afraid to turn to your teammates and say:  thinking about using this library X or this package Y, I have seen some examples on here, what do you think? Not only will this show that you are proactive, but it also spark some conversation/debate from the team. You might have discovered something awesome no one else knew about yet! We have all seen those movies. The ones where a hacker types rapidly as pages of code scroll down the monitors in front of them. In the real world, developers spend more time reading code than actually writing code. When adding new features or fixing defects, you will have to understand the current codebase you are working on. How do you do this? Read, read, read! Reading code is also a beneficial learning technique. Reading existing code lets you see how others have developed a certain feature. Things to keep an eye out for: - The use of design patterns - The naming of methods, classes, and variables - The use of commentsHow to structure project files - The use of tests and how they are structured So where do you find code to read? Repositories in your source control at workProjects on GitHubRead answers/questions on StackOverflowCode challenge websites such as codewars.com, which show the answers to challengesHave fun! If you take one thing away from this article, let it be this it important to have fun. Enjoy writing code, solving problems, and continuing to learn. You are at the start of an exciting career, so sit back and enjoy the ride! - Learn the lingo. We developers have our own funny language ( a branch has nothing to do with trees!) so make sure you understand the key terms - Get to know your IDE. Learn the hotkeys, shortcuts, and customize it until you are comfortable with it. This will increase your productivity. - Working on bugs is a great way to learn about the codebase. So don be afraid to pick these up!Bring a notebook, listen with intent and write everything down. - Take on some side projects in your spare time. It a great way to learn different technologies you don learn in your day job and will boost your CV. - Getting involved in work events is a great way to get to know your colleagues.

       "  \"I recently read the Promise combinators article in v8 blog. It's about two upcoming methods in Promise API: Promise.allSettled() and Promise.any(). And I feel frustrated. The design of these methods looks to me inconsistent with current Promise API. Let me share my opinion below. According to article: The use-case is to send several API calls and wait for all finished: For sure, this is useful. But this task can be easily solved with\\xa0.map() and Promise.all(). The change is minimal: Is it worth implementing a new core method that can be solved in a few lines of code? As for me this is a library-land feature, not the core API method. But more important is that Promise.allSettled brings extra level of abstraction. Unlike Promise.all it fulfills with array of wrapping objects {status, reason} instead of pure promise values. As a developer I don like it. I expect that methods with similar names\\xa0.all()/.allSettled() behave similar ways. But they don Moreover, the code with Promise.allSettled encourages late errors handling. Errors supposed to be filtered out from the final result instead of traditional catch block. This, in turn, has the following downsides: Using current  Promise.all you avoid such things. In other words Promise.any is Promise.race that ignores rejections. The use-case is to check several endpoints and take data from the first successful one: I agree sometimes it may be useful. But how often? In how many projects did you use the pattern  several parallel requests to identical endpoints for the same data Feel free to share in comments. But from my vision very often. Couldn it be more useful for community to get native implementation of bluebird Promise.each() or Promise.delay()\\xa0? Moreover, Promise.any introduces a new type of error Such error contains links to other errors if all promises are rejected. One more error handling approach! It differs from Promise.allSettled where errors are extracted from success result. It also differs from Promise.all/Promise.race which reject with just an Error instance. How will JavaScript look like if every new Promise API method will introduce new way of error handling? Although the proposal is on a very early stage, I concerned about the direction. Based on current Promise API the implementation of Promise.any is a bit tricky but actually two lines of code: Maybe keep it in library-land? Why Promise.all and Promise.race are so pretty?\\xa0 Because they behave very consistent and similar to usual promises: fulfill with just a value and reject with just an error. No wrapped values, no accumulated errors, no extra complexity. Why Promise.allSettled and Promise.any are so weird to me? Promise.allSettled fulfills with array of objects with status and reason wrapping underlying promise values. And rejects never. Promise.any fulfills with a single value but ignores intermediate rejections. Only if all promises are rejected it rejects with accumulated reason wrapping all underlying reasons. These new approaches are really difficult to put in my head. As they are quite different from the current Promise API. I suppose a popular job interview question in 2020: What the difference of these four methods? Although it cool question I don think core API should encourage such complexity. I also disappointed with naming. Four methods with slightly different behavior should have pretty clear names. Otherwise I have to re-check MDN every time I meet them in code. From the proposal of Promise.any: Let me to disagree. For me the name of Promise.any is confusing: I think, the name of each method should explicitly define the condition when the method fulfills. I would suggest the following naming convention: It reflects four possible combinations of promise states. It explains why these methods are referenced as combinators in proposal. Of course, such rename is not possible as Promise.all and Promise.race already landed and used in many applications. But for new methods having some naming strategy would be very helpful. In general I'm not inspired with the concept of non-thrown  rejections. In fact, new Promise API provides a way to silently ignore errors in the code: Currently no other core JavaScript API does that. The only way to ignore an error wrap it into try..catch/.catch() with empty body. And write a comment why do you ignore error here, otherwise eslint will warn you. I think the core API should expose all errors. It is always a developer decision whether to handle error or not. It should be explicit for other developers reading the code. Just imagine how many hours of debugging will be spent due to inaccurate usage of swallowed rejections! Especially when dealing with third-party code something does not work and no errors thrown. I use promises every working day. As well as many other developers do. I love JavaScript for its async nature. Having clear and intuitive API allows me to solve tasks faster and be more productive. That why I think Promise API should be treated and changed very carefully. Thanks for reading and welcome to comments.\",\n",
       "  'The incredible growth in new technologies like machine learning has helped web developers build new AI applications in ways easier than ever. In the present day, most AI enthusiasts and developers in the field leverage Python frameworks for AI & machine learning development. But looking around, one may also find that JavaScript-based frameworks are also being implemented in AI. While the Python programming language feeds most machine learning frameworks, JavaScript has not lagged behind. This is the reason why JavaScript developers are using a number of frameworks for training and implementing machine learning models in the browser.\\xa0 In this blog, we will discuss various top machine learning JavaScript frameworks that you must consider for you seeking business growth through AI & machine learning. Brain.js is an open-source JavaScript library used to run and process neural networks. It is particularly useful for developers venturing into machine learning, and would best for those among them already acquainted with the complexities of JavaScript.\\xa0 Brain.js is generally used with Node.js or a client-side browser to train machine learning models. To set up Brain.js, use the following code: npm install brain.js However, to install the Naive Bayesian classifier, use the following code: npm install classifier You can also include library in the browser using the code given below: ML.js primarily aims to make machine learning accessible to a broader audience which includes creators, students and artists. It a JavaScript library that provides algorithms and tools within the browser working on top of Tensorflow.js without any external dependency. First, you need to set up the ML.js tool using the following code: Here, I have listed the machine learning algorithms which are supported: Supervised learning includes: K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) Simple linear regression Naive Bayes Random forest Decision tree: CART Partial least squares (PLS) Logistic regression Unsupervised learning includes: K-means clustering Principal component analysis (PCA) Using KeraJS, you can easily run Keras models in the browser with support of GPU via WebGL. These models can also be run in Node.js but only in CPU mode.\\xa0 I have listed out some Keras models that can be run in the browser: Bidirectional LSTM for IMDB sentiment classification DenseNet-121, trained on ImageNet 50-layer residual network, trained on ImageNet Convolutional variational autoencoder, trained on MNIST Basic convnet for MNIST Auxiliary classifier generative adversarial networks (AC-GAN) on MNIST Inception v3, trained on ImageNet SqueezeNet v1.1, trained on ImageNet It is a machine learning framework used for Node.js.  Limdu.js is ideally suited for language processing chatbots and other dialog systems. You can install it by using the following command: npm install limdu It supports some of the following: It is an open source machine learning JavaScript library maintained by Google.  It can be used for different purposes like understanding ML models, training neural networks in the browser, for educational purposes, etc.\\xa0 Tensorflow.js allows training of machine learning models in JavaScript and facilitates its subsequent deployment in the browser or on Node.js. By using this framework, you can run pre-trained models in an inference model. In fact, one can write the code in Typescript (ES6 JavaScript or ES5 JavaScript).  You can quickly start by including the following code within a header tag in the HTML file and writing JS programs to build the model.\\xa0 Also Check: 20 Best AI and Machine Learning Companies for Startups & SMEs in 2019)   It is a machine learning JavaScript library that provides a numpy infrastructure backed by GPUs, especially for scientific computing. It can be used for both the browser and the NodeJS applications.\\xa0 The following is the configuration code for the browser: For a nodejs application, you need to use the following code: npm install propel import { grad } from \"propel\"; To build advanced statistical models and machine learning libraries, this JavaScript library is used. It can further be used for plotting and graphics functionality for exploratory data analysis and data visualization.\\xa0 In relation to ML, the list of libraries is given below: For instance: @stdlib/ml/online-binary-classification For example: @stdlib/ml/online-sgd-regression For example: @stdlib/nlp This JavaScript library is used to train neural networks(deep learning models) entirely in the browser. The NodeJs app can use this library too. To start with it, you need to get its minified version using ConvNetJS minified library.  Use the following code: <script src=\"convnet-min.js\"></script> So far we have seen the top 8 JavaScript machine frameworks which you must consider for your web development in 2019.  Obviously, JavaScript is not becoming the language of choice for Machine Learning, far from it! However, common problems, such as performance, Matrix manipulations and the abundance of useful libraries, are slowly being overcome, closing the gap between common applications and using machine learning. Hence, the above-listed machine learning JavaScript libraries will be helpful if you looking for an alternative to python frameworks for machine learning development. Moreover, I invite you to suggest more libraries or useful projects which can be added to the list.  ',\n",

       "  \"Two things appear to be repetitively accurate about emerging technologies. First, content production studios often set unrealistic expectations on what possible and what isn with new devices and systems. Second, innovators of all types are doing their best to catch up with fiction and sometimes have to remind everybody that what onscreen can be misleading.\\xa0 Remember the movie  starring George Clooney and a whiz kid in a futuristic city? The film was memorable because it gave us a utopian vision of the future. Here's a preview for those who haven't seen the movie: But Tomorrowland also made me wonder whether we anywhere near to witness the advancements portrayed by the time I have grandkids  say 2050? Let consider skyscrapers, sentient robots, and flying machines, depicted as part of a more holistic smart city. Producers played to our fantasies with lots of special effects (mostly done through advanced 3D animation). Not surprisingly, little of what shown in the movie will find a possible equivalent in real life. However, it doesn that existing or smart city applications in development are not to be proud of.\\xa0 Some intelligent urban systems and living spaces with smart waste collection, traffic, lighting, parking, water management, are becoming a reality through connected sensors and IoT. One of the more fascinating characters in the movie was the audio-animatronic Athena who travels back and forth between Tomorrowland and Clooney reality to recruit people to live in the city. She is a sentient machine that looks, acts, and thinks like a human. Are we anywhere near building one today?\\xa0 The answer is  yet, but we are certainly making advances in the fields of AI and robotics. Scientists even succeeded in creating robot proteins that can be used to fix our cells and DNA. Most undertakings are still in the experimental stage, though. It a slow process, and it will take time. Still, other AI and robotics achievements  think cobots, for example  may indicate that an Athena in our midst may not be so far ahead. It always a thrill to think of cars that could travel both on land and fly. Many of those appeared in the movie, but again, are they within our reach within a few decades? In reality, many would agree that the closest innovation entering or close to enter our day to day are driverless cars. They still on the ground, though, and far from being entirely functional.\\xa0 Other connected vehicles are already hitting the road, and their applications rely on Internet-connected devices and sensors. These allow to give notice of road hazards meter or miles ahead, run self-diagnostics, or event alert emergency services and authorities in case of an accident. --- Fiction shows us what our cities, vehicles, and coworkers could become, challenging the best of the best to make today fantasy tomorrow reality.

       "  'Recently I read a great book that was on my \"to read\" list for quite some time, namely: \"Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies\" by Professor Nick Bostrom. In the book -a tough, but great read- Prof. Bostrom shares his views on the opportunities and risks to human kind, associated with the ongoing development of Artificial Intelligence(A.I.). Using his broad knowledge of Mathematics, Engineering, Medicine, Social science and Philosophy, Prof. Bostrom explains the possible dangers associated with A.I. reaching the level of Superintelligence. Superintelligence is a term used to describe the level of artificial intelligence that far surpasses the intelligence of the brightest human minds alive today, or will come in the future. So after reading the book and doing some further post reading \"research\", a question kept popping up in my mind: Why would we ever want Superintelligence ??? Now before offering my view on a possible answer to this question -and eventually relating it back to the title of this article-, I think it is good to first go over some commonly used terms and concepts of A.I., without going too much in detail... I hope. Weak versus Strong A.I. Artificial Intelligence or A.I., as a term and even a discipline, was introduced by one of the \"founding fathers of A.I.\", John McCarthy(Lisp programming anyone?), during the famous Dartmouth conference in the mid-fifties of the previous century. The late, great John McCarthy defined A.I. as  science and engineering of making intelligent machines. The levels of \"intelligence\" that the machines achieve versus humans can be classed as: Weak A.I is an algorithm used by machines that has been written or has been trained to do one thing(or a very narrow set), and it does that one thing \"better\" than humans can.Strong A.I. on the other hand, is an algorithm or set of algorithms that can perform all tasks as well as, or better than humans. To be clear, Strong A.I. does not exist today, it is merely an idea at present... but more on that later. We live in an age of Weak A.I., and although it may be called weak, it is quite impressive what this A.I. is able to achieve across many different fields of science, industry and business, as well as getting embedded in many parts of human society. Weak A.I. today takes basically 2 main approaches to reach a level of Artificial Intelligence Good Old Fashioned A.I. (GOFAI) or Symbolic AI which is basically an algorithm that uses a combination of IF-THEN statements or rule engines and complex statistical models written by hand. Examples of GOFAI are IBM\\'s Deepblue and chatbots Machine Learning(ML) or non-Symbolic A.I. makes use of algorithms that are able to adjust themselves based on the data they are exposed to. In essence able to \"learn\" much like a human child does. Examples of ML are in self-driving cars, facial recognition and Google\\'s AlphaGo Machine Learning algorithms are mainly -but not limited to- trying to simulate how parts of the human brain works...at least as we think it does. In essence they make use of something called artificial \"neural networks\", which consist of weighted connections between input and output layers, as well as a hidden layer consisting of units that transform the input into, something that the output layer can use. Together with different \"learning rules\", and backpropogation, the ML detects patterns until an optimized output is produced. Deep Learning is basically a form of ML with many more (hidden) layers. Deep learning is showing promise towards A.I. becoming better than humans at a number of domains rather than just one, and therefore pave the way to Strong A.I. e.g Google\\'s AlphaZero... But that is yet to be determined. Don\\'t make the mistake of assuming that GOFAI is vastly inferior to ML, they both have their pros and cons, determined by how efficient they are able to tackle a problem. The combination of both GOFAI and ML is what will probably lead to the best results going forward. The summer of A.I. During the decades following the Dartmouth conference in the 1950\\'s, different schools of thought on A.I. had gained momentum, to always end up falling in what has been called the A.I. winters, which is considered to be a period of reduced funding and interest in A.I. research. Since the beginning of this decade A.I. has seen a surge in investments and research advancements, as well as \"real life\" applications of A.I.. Some have stated that a new A.I. \"winter is coming\", whilst others state that we have just entered an A.I. spring, the latter view I share. How long before summer, that I dare not predict. I think as with many things, the law of diminishing returns drives where we are on a \"hype cycle\". With an important difference with the previous era, being that both human society, as well as businesses, are seeing actual tangible benefits of the application of A.I. i.e. there is a demand, and the demand is growing. The intelligence explosion...Superintelligence As outlined above, Strong A.I. does not exist today, however there are a lot of areas of A.I. research, which are essentially looking into creating A.I. enabled machines that will be at least as intelligent as us humans, at all tasks. The rate at which technology is advancing has never been as fast as today. As an example: computational power increases are breaking Moore\\'s Law of exponential growth, where power doubled every 2 years, and rather Neven\\'s Law of doubly exponential -trust me it is huge- now seen in quantum computing is believed to be the next \"law\". Some \"hot\" areas of research on Strong A.I. enablers today are Genetic and evolutionary algorithms: in essence this is where an algorithm is created that mimics natural selection algorithms, and according to \"fitness\" is able to produce an A.I. that will basically be the best that it can be...ever. One of the biggest challenges here is that we do not yet have enough data to truly understand how evolution works, but with the knowledge we have today, combined with deep learning, might enable more rapid advances towards Strong A.I. Whole Brain Emulation or WBE: rather than trying to understand how a human brain works, and building an A.I. that works according to the human brain algorithms, one actually scans(slices) and \"records\" the entire brain and uploads the data into a computer. I know this sounds very sci-fi, but although we miss the technology to do this at present, some are quite confident that within 50 to 100 years the needed technology would be there to do this. Deep learning next gen: as mentioned before the combination of GOFAI and Machine Learning(Deep learning) is most likely going to increase the level of artificial intelligence across many domains, rather than just one. The combination of rapid increases in technology combined with newer Deep learning algorithms, could in fact allow for the A.I. to learn itself to become Strong.Several other areas exist, but are a bit too controversial to mention here IMHO Brilliant people such as Nick Bostrom, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, (late)Stephen Hawking, late John McCarthy, believe that once A.I. reaches the same level as human intelligence, they would be able to quickly become more intelligent than humans i.e. the genesis of Superintelligence. The rate at which this would happen would be so fast, that it would be like an intelligence explosion. Debate is still ongoing what this would mean to humankind, with many saying this would be the end of it. On this possibility I am not going to offer any opinion. The possible answer to the why Ok, hope you are still with me at this point. As I mentioned before the \"why would we want superintelligence\" is not so clear to me, nor do I find a general consensus amongst the A.I. \"community\". Yes, there is the growing demand for Weak A.I. to become more prevalent and better.Yes, there is an ongoing A.I. race similar to the arms race, in the sense that some want to ensure they have better A.I. than others, whether that is for financial, knowledge, political or military power gain. However these can be considered to be rather demands for \"stronger\" Weak A.I., not Strong A.I. or even Superintelligence. There is the doomsday scenario on why we would not want this, but this does not seem to be enough for the general A.I. community to agree not to want it. The proposed answer for me would indeed be: we should NOT want Superintelligence.  Superintelligence, is actually such a fuzzy concept which cannot be explained with our current level of intelligence, so neither can the potential benefits or threats. I would even argue that Strong A.I. therefore is also not desired, as remember, the achievement of one is highly likely to lead to the genesis of the other. Prof. Nick Bostrom has outlined something called \"Differential technological development\", which states that societies should strive to retard the development of harmful technologies and their applications, while accelerating the development of beneficial technologies, especially those that offer protection against the harmful ones. To me that means we should actually strive to keep the Weak A.I. and just improve it, with speed being dictated by domain priority, but not to the point of reaching Strong A.I., and so of the 2, ensure the survival of the weakest...A.I. Would love to hear your thoughts. PS: Prof Nick Bostrom has a great website https://nickbostrom.com/ with loads of interesting material on several different topics, not just on A.I.. Also Oren Etzioni, CEO of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, has written great stuff on A.I. and is actually of the opposing school of thought than Prof Nick Bostrom on the possible doomsday scenario of A.I.

       "  'During the past few months, I was really lucky to have interviewed Top Kagglers, Researchers and Practitioners. These interviews were released in a blog format and each week and all of the ML heroes were kind enough to share many amazing words for beginners, share about their journey into the field. Chai Time Data Science is the reboot of Machine Learning Interviews I been working on this project during the past 3 months, and I super happy to share that the first episode will be released on Sunday, 21st July with Weekly releases every Sunday and Thursday. I talk all about the show in a bit, but first I really like to share the best advice from the previous 25 interviews. Note that this would be a very condensed and maybe advice with a slight lack of context. I suggest you to also check out all of the interviews for a much detailed and richer guidance. Interview with DL Practitioner: Dominic Monn Don be afraid to get your name out and your hands dirty as early as possible  both in business and Machine Learning. Ship fast and get internships, be determined and the rest will come by itself. Interview with Deep Learning Freelancer Tuatini Godard Don give up, data science is a multidisciplinary field and it hard to be good on every front. Choose a specialization at first and put all your energy on it. For instance I chose deep learning for computer vision instead of say, time series or\\xa0NLP. Don get fooled by the AI hype like me when I started 2 years ago, there is no AI (or AGI, call it the way you want), if you choose the computer vision path, then you become a computer vision expert, for NLP you become a NLP expert. Deep learning only helps to solve a part of the big picture, it not the big picture itself, only a tool to add to your toolbelt. As an freelancer or an  (call it the way you want) you will be asked to do more than just playing with deep learning models most of the time. Learn about data preparation, software engineering skills, some devops and co, basically the whole stack to create and ship a deep learning project in production, not just the fun part. But most importantly, learn to learn and to adapt, keep an eye on the latest trends and always stay up to date on what is going on as things moves really fast in the field of data science. Interview with Kaggle Kernels Expert: Aakash Nain: At some point in time, you would also feel low seeing the amount of research going on. It is okay if you feel that way. There are only two things that we should always remember: 1) Your success isn dependent on others and vice-versa. 2) Never be shy/afraid to ask even the most basic things. If you don ask, you are the one who is hindering your progress. Interview with Twice Kaggle Grandmaster: Dr. Jean-Francois Puget (CPMP) Read write ups of top teams after each competition ends. It is better if you entered the competition, as you will get more from the write up, but reading all write ups is useful IMHO. That when you learn the most on Kaggle. Interview with Kaggle Competitions Grandmaster: KazAnova (Rank #3): Dr. Marios Michailidis Understand the problem and the\\xa0metric\\xa0we are tested on- this is key. Create a reliable cross-validation process that best would resemble the leaderboard or the test set in general as this will allow me to explore many different algorithms and approaches, knowing the impact they could yield. Understand the importance of different algorithmic families, to see when and where to maximize the intensity (is it a linear or non-linear type of problem?) Try many different approaches/techniques on the given problem and seize it from all possible angles in terms of algorithms  hyper parameter optimization, feature engineering, missing values treatment- I treat all these elements as hyperparameters of the final solution. Interview with Deep Learning and NLP Researcher: Sebastian Ruder I had the best experience writing a blog when I started out writing it for myself to understand a particular topic better. If you ever find yourself having to put in a lot of work to build intuition or do a lot of research to grasp a subject, consider writing a post about it so you can accelerate everyone else learning in the future. In research papers, there usually not enough space to properly contextualize a work, highlight motivations, and intuitions, etc. Blog posts are a great way to make technical content more accessible and approachable. The great thing about a blog is that it doesn need to be perfect. You can use it to improve your communication skills as well as obtain feedback on your ideas and things you might have missed. Interview with Deep Learning Researcher and The GANfather: Dr. Ian Goodfellow Start by learning the basics really well: programming, debugging, linear algebra, probability. Most advanced research projects require you to be excellent at the basics much more than they require you to know something extremely advanced. For example, today I am working on debugging a memory leak that is preventing me from running one of my experiments, and I am working on speeding up the unit tests for a software library so that we can try out more research ideas faster. When I was an undergrad and early PhD student I used to ask Andrew Ng for advice a lot and he always told me to work on thorough mastery of these basics. I thought that was really boring and had been hoping he tell me to learn about hyperreal numbers or something like that, but now several years in I think that advice was definitely correct. Interview with OpenAI Fellow: Christine McLeavey Payne In terms of specifics  one of my favorite pieces of advice was from FastAI Jeremy Howard. He told me to focus on making one really great project that showed off my skills. He says that so many people have many interesting but half-finished projects on github, and that it much better to have a single one that is really polished. The other thing I add is that I learned the most about deep learning when I taught it to others. I became a mentor for Andrew Ng Coursera courses, and trying to answer other students questions pushed me to understand the material at a much deeper level. Whenever you learn a new topic, try explaining it to someone else (this also be great preparation for job interviews!). Interview with The Youngest Kaggle Grandmaster: Mikel Bober-Irizar (anokas) if you just starting out it useful to take a look at the playground competitions or previous competitions from the last few years. Kaggle Kernels are probably the best resource for learning, as people share tons of analysis and solutions to all the competitions. The most important thing is just to experiment for yourself and try to improve the score! Interview with Deep Learning Researcher and Leader of OpenMined: Andrew Trask The secret to getting into the deep learning community is high quality blogging. Read 5 different blog posts about the same subject and then try to synthesize your own view. Don just write something ok, either  take 3 or 4 full days on a post and try to make it as short and simple (yet complete) as possible. Re-write it multiple times. As you write and re-write and think about the topic you trying to teach, you will come to understand it. Furthermore, other people will come to understand it as well (and they understand that you understand it, which helps you get a job). Most folks want someone to hold their hand through the process, but the best way to learn is to write a blogpost that holds someone else hand, step by step (with toy code examples!). Also, when you do code examples, don write some big object-oriented mess. Fewer lines the better. Make it a script. Only use numpy. Teach what each line does. Rinse and repeat. When you feel comfortable enough you then be able to do this with recently published papers  which is when you really know you making progress! Interview with The Creator of Keras, AI Researcher: FranÃ§ois Chollet I don think you should tie your dreams to external markers of status, like working for a specific big-name company, or making a specific amount of money, or attaining a specific job title. Figure out what you value in life, and then stay true to your values. You never have to regret a single decision. Interview with the Author of PyImageSearch and Computer Vision Practitioner: Dr. Adrian Rosebrock One of the worst ways to start writing anything, whether technical or not, is to open a new document and expect that you have words pouring out of you, magically filling up the page  it rarely works like that and it normally a recipe for frustration and failure. Instead, I recommend outlining first. I personally outline in bullet points. Start with your headers first  what are you going to cover? And in what order? From there you back and start filling in the sub-headers. What do you need to cover in each section? Finally, I go back and include the details for each section. Sometimes I even write in complete sentences, but that a personal choice. I always leave notes to myself such as  an image here or  X-Y of some_script.py go here I try to keep myself focused on the actual writing process as much as I can. The actual images and code can be inserted later during typesetting. Interview with Kaggle GrandMaster, Data Scientist: Dr. Bojan Tunguz Don be afraid to fail and try to learn from your mistakes. Read the discussions in the forums, take a look at the best kernels, and try to improve upon them. Interview with Deep Learning Researcher at fast.ai: Sylvain Gugger It not that the theory is useless, and it going to be a critical piece to help a beginner forge its intuition, but starting with training an actual model and deploying it before explaining what is behind it makes a lot of sense. Interview with the Chief Scientist at Salesforce: Dr. Richard Socher Differentiate between unfounded fears and the actual threats. AI bias is an imminent fear that needs to be addressed, whereasdoomsday scenarios are a dangerous distraction. People need to start paying close attention to making sure the data sets that AI is trained on is diverse and free of bias, and that the teams building these systems also represent a diverse set of perspectives. Interview with Data Scientist at kaggle: Dr. Rachael Tatman My universal advice is to\\xa0not\\xa0get a Ph.D. I even\\xa0wrote a blog post about it a while ago. The blog about linguistics specifically, but most of it applies to machine learning as well. I think that having a Ph.D. can be an advantage when you looking for data science jobs, but unless you really want to 1) do research or 2) be a professor there no really no benefit to getting a Ph.D. that you can can get more quickly doing something else. I think that Kaggle, or other practical experience, will get you to the point where you can apply for jobs much more quickly. I probably wouldn recommend\\xa0only\\xa0doing Kaggle competitions, though. You learn a lot about algorithms that way, but you won get as much practice with things like cleaning data or designing metrics. That part of the reason I suggest that people work on their own projects as well. That shows off your ability to come up with interesting questions, source and annotate data, clean your data and think about what users want. Interview with Deep Learning freelance consultant and Blockchain dev: Mamy AndrÃ©-Ratsimbazafy I think most recruiters and companies are not mature enough to evaluate candidates. Many are still building up their teams and don have the in-house expertise to look for external signs of competence for recruiting. I much more concerned about the experience requirements. The rise of deep learning was in 2012 with AlexNet. Besides the US, I would guess that many data science focused masters were created around 2014 in universities so most new hires with an actual data science degree would have at most about 3 years of experience. Most more experienced people would probably be self-taught. Interview with Twice Kaggle GrandMaster and Data Scientist at H2O.ai: Sudalai Rajkumar Read multiple good kernels and try to understand them in detail. Learn how they create insights from the data, the plots they have used to portray the data, the inferences that they have come up with. It is also a good idea to take up a new concept (like a new algo or a novel technique) and educate people about the same. I personally do not like the kernels which just blends the output of two or three other kernels and get a high score. Interview with Radiologist, fast.ai fellow and Kaggle expert: Dr. Alexandre Cadrin-Chenevert Participating in Kaggle competitions was of paramount importance in my learning curve of deep learning. Maturation of almost any learning process is based on the transformation of knowledge to skills, or concept to actions. Each competition is an opportunity to evolve in this direction. But, naturally, the tradeoff is the time you invest in these competitions. So my own perspective was to participate in a limited number of computer vision competitions selected to catch efficiently most of the potential benefit. Interview with the Creator of DeOldify, fast.ai student: Jason Antic Yes, you definitely have to know when to quit, and that quite the art. I say  to, and/or quit, a lot of things actually. Why? Because for everything you say  to, you saying  to many other things. Time (and sanity) is precious. As a result, especially lately, I said  to quite a few opportunities that others find crazy to say  to. So quitting for me is decided first on whether or not the path falls squarely in my realm of values, interests, and maintaining sanity. If you talking about an ambitious technological project, then you have to go one step further and evaluate whether or not it actually feasible. Often you simply can answer that right away, especially if you doing an ambitious project! So that why you experiment. If you discover a sound reason (and not just a rage-quit rationalization) as to why something won work, then quit, learn from it, and move on! But be careful on this point  a lot of problems are solved handily simply by shifting perspective a bit. For this reason, I stick with a problem a bit longer than seems reasonable, because often my perspective is simply wrong. Often the solution comes when I walk away (shower thoughts, basically). Interview with Kaggle Grandmaster, Head of Computer Vision at X5 Retail Group: Artur Kuzin Kaggle allows you to very quickly develop a specific skill set. With the right approach, these skills can be converted into the necessary quality for work (https://habr.com/ru/company/ods/blog/439812/\\xa0). Also, competitions allow you to try a lot of different tasks and greatly expand your knowledge. Finally, it is insanely fun if you are able to find such a friendly community like ODS.ai. Interview with Senior Research Scientist at the United States Naval Research Laboratory: Dr. Leslie Smith Well, if I am reading a paper and it leads to an idea, a big factor is if the authors made their code available. If so, I download it and run it to replicate their experiments. Then I can quickly try out my own idea to see if it makes sense. Quick prototyping is important to me here. Also, their code provides a baseline. Interview with Kaggle Grandmaster, Senior Computer Vision Engineer at Lyft: Dr. Vladimir I. Iglovikov I really hope that more and more Kagglers will invest in writing. It can be blog posts, papers, or something else. More information flowing between people is better. Writing a blog post or tech report will help you to structure thoughts on the problems, it will help other people to have a warm start on similar challenges and, most likely, it will help you with career opportunities. Which means that you will work on more exciting problems and being better paid at the same time. Interview with Kaggle Grandmaster, Data Scientist at Point API (NLP startup): Pavel Pleskov So, my advice to everyone: don waste precious time and begin practicing as soon as possible  you will close the gaps in theory later on. It a re-boot of the earlier series as well as a: PodcastVideo InterviewsBlog post interviews Now that I have just graduated and unfortunately not been able to make it to the Google AI Residency Program, I decided to dedicate the time to make the interviews available as Video, Audio and Blog Posts! This is possible since I work remotely, but that discussion is for the show (Episode to be released very soon!) During my final semester at college, I had the bandwidth to contribute much more to the community: I spent a lot of time with the Data Science Network and TWiMLAI communities. I decided to spend 50 hours/month to open my calendar for anyone to have a  Time DS Conversation Since I was already a contributor and recognized by the amazing people. My slots got booked in under 1 day for the complete month! Next, I decided to open a poll and if I got more than >25 emoji reactions (a new way of voting, isn it?) And that too got booked in under 1 day! I ended up doing 3 conversations every day, every week for the complete Month of May, June. I personally learned a lot while helping the community out. The usual theme of the conversations would be Kaggle, fast.ai, Project ideas. I highly encourage anyone reading this to try doing this! Hence the name, Chai Time Show sounded most apt. The show is also a collection of the most FAQ to me with a single hope as always, to help the community grow and become better Data Science Practitioners. Hope you enjoy the show! Go check out the website here: and please tune in each week for Data Science discussions along with chai. The show will be released across all of the most commonly used Podcasting platforms, YouTube where the video recordings will be released and of course via blogposts.

       "  'On June 4 Minsk (Belarus) hosted EMERGE, the largest IT conference in Eastern Europe. Speakers from all over the world flocked to the capital of one of the fastest growing technological hubs in the region. There, they shared their valuable insights on what on the tech table today. Iflexion lucked out to visit the conference and share its key takeaways with the world. Lit with club-like neons, the conference venue hardly left anybody in doubt about what to do. Three stages welcomed a total of 64 speakers from the US, UK, and Europe. At the same time, the Startup Alley hosted 127 teams from 20 countries, all there to present their products to those interested. Meanwhile, the Mix & Match Zone played host to the attendees in search of new business partners. As for the conference biggest intrigue, it was surely the EMERGE Challenge, where 11 shortlisted startups were competing for a  reward. Every startup presented their 3-minute pitches to the jury of practicing investors, with the prize awarded to Usedesk, an AI-enabled helpdesk platform. From great speeches to epic parties and side-events, we tried to be everywhere so not to miss a single idea voiced. Now we share what impressed us most. Dr. Lev Manovich lives in New York and teaches Computer Science at the City University of New York. He also studies how technologies influence modern media, which became the topic of his keynote at EMERGE. In his speech, Dr. Manovich addressed the common fear that AI will kill art eventually. From image correction to creating unique artworks, AI is finding more applications in arts. Many worry that such excessive use of technologies would smash creativity and lead to AI-run  totalitarianism. Manovich rejected that idea and noted that art had always been somewhat algorithmic. To prove it, he showed the works of Jackson Pollock, an artist who always tried to break predictability but, according to Manovich, still followed certain algorithms in his art. Manovich made a point that we shouldn fear the algorithm but embrace it. Bringing together the best from such disciplines as AI consulting and art, we be able to transform the very act of creation, Manovich predicts. [Lev Manovich believes that art has always been algorithmic, and these abstract works by Jackson Pollock were to prove\\xa0it.] If you still choose products labeled  you probably found Alexandra Genis speech quite thought-provoking. Alexandra is a founder of TAS2R, a Critical Food Design studio that literally creates the food of tomorrow. She opened her speech by asking the audience whether broccoli looked organic to them. As the majority voted  Alexandra justly noted that broccoli doesn grow in the wild but only on human-made fields. The speaker stated that this fact really questions the  of food we believe to be organic. All in all, most of the snacks we eat are already wholly artificial, so why not become a little more creative in our artificialness? In her studio, designers and biologists are working on synthetic flavors. Mixing available molecules, they develop different tastes, from well-known ones like strawberry to something completely new. The method of molecule blending allows adding absolutely any taste to edible substances. At long last, it might help us feed the growing population that is soon to hit 9 billion people. [Alexandra showing how the food of tomorrow can look\\xa0like] Steward Rogers, a digital nomad and tech industry veteran, visited EMERGE to share his ideas on what wrong with the mental health in the industry. That for a solid reason: according to him, the number of suicides and bipolar disorder cases among startup founders skyrocketed during the last ten years. Rogers believes that these sobering numbers are the after-effect of today entrepreneurial culture imposing a high level of stress, endless deadlines, and fundraising pressure. In his speech, he offered startups and tech companies to get away from the office environment more often. Rogers reminded that taking yourself away from the computer screen and reconnecting with nature is an excellent way to refresh. Meditation, he claimed, could also help you feel better rewires the brain and puts you in a state of mind when you entirely focus on the present moment. Rogers also recommended playing more, be it just swings or a family football match. That because when one plays, their mind is subconsciously planning the next piece of work to get down to. Lysandre Follet, Director of Computational Design at Nike, told how the company uses technology for creating sneakers that perfectly fit every particular athlete. Nike puts sensors on an athlete body and uses motion capture and high-speed video to objectively see a sportsperson in motion. Nike testing room is also equipped with force plates taking thousands of an athlete measurements every second. All the gathered data helps to form best-match sneakers as they support every move a sportsperson makes while running or jumping. Following this method of generative design, Nike manages to create the shoes that match not only an athlete shoe size but also other no less important characteristics. On the second day of the conference, all the attendees and finalists were on the watch for the EMERGE Challenge results. Among the teams having made it to the finals were such startups as RedTrack, Speakus, Swipio, Epico, and WebTotem. In the end, the  prize landed in the hands of Usedesk. The startup developed an AI-powered helpdesk platform connecting up to eight B2B communication channels within a single interface. With the help of AI, users can also set up autoreplies for standard requests and create rules to change statuses automatically. While not getting to the finals, some participating startups gained traction too. Skinive.com is a startup that developed an AI-powered app that can detect dermatological conditions by skin images. While demonstrating their product at the Startup Alley, the Skinive team detected a pre-cancer form of skin neoplasm for one of the EMERGE participants. The diagnosis was later confirmed by two dermatologists. Bonaka became another startup discovery as it got an investment promise from The Untitled Ventures. Bonaka is a biotech company that uses bacteria solutions for cleaning industrial equipment like heating systems, heat exchangers, and boilers. The cleantech team says this method causes no structural changes to equipment. [Startup Alley really lived up to its\\xa0name] This was only a sketch of some of the amazing EMERGE participants. In reality, each speaker and startup had a great idea to share, and their passion for what they do was nothing but a bout of motivation for all of us. We had a great time networking and feeding off some of the most exciting speeches from tech insiders. In the end, we left EMERGE with a conviction: the age when technologies break through the boundaries of what we deem impossible now is just around the corner. ',\n",
       "  'People have countless fantasies about Artificial Intelligence. It has become the most popular theme in novels and movies. When we dream about AI, we often fancy a world with Iron Man and his intelligent assistant J.A.R.V.I.S (or it replacement FRIDAY); Baymax from Big Hero 6; or the high-tech adult theme park from Westworld. However, due to the current technological advancement, the humanoid robots that transcend our human ability is still far away from us. Artificial Intelligence tools nowadays serve as assistants to our lives and solve pain points that could not be addressed before. First, let take a brief look at the history of AI. The field of AI was formally established at a conference held at Dartmouth University in 1956 and coined the term  Intelligence. Between 1956 and 1974, universities and government agencies invested a countless amount of money and resources in AI researches. Different types of computers were invented that were solving algebra, geometry, and so on. The success of this period made people overly optimistic and began to have high expectations for AI. However, the technology and hardware equipment at the time could not keep up with the novel AI, leading to the first AI winter started in 1974. The winter continued until the early 1980s, due to the rise of the expert systems, coupled with Japan $850 million attempt to create a computer with supercomputing power with human intelligence, known as the Fifth generation computer project. Japan has long been obsessed with humanoid robots. The widely-known science-fiction franchise, Gundam (humanoid vehicles with advanced AI systems), was started in 1979. The original Ghost In The Shell comic was also first released in 1989. To compete with Japan, the British government also invested in AI again during the same period. During this period, computer hardware boomed. The computers mentioned here were not the kinds known to the average joes but used by professionals with no interface and only a bunch of codes. In 1987, Apple and IBM both developed their own versions of desktop computer (similar to the ones we are using today) with higher performance than those professional computers. This has led to the collapse of the $500 million expert system industry leading to the second AI winter. It wasn until 1997 when IBM Deep Blue defeated chess champion, Garry Kasparov, that made the general public to realize the power of AI. At the same time, the tech industry faced the Dot-com bubble. Funds invested in AI were exhausted. However, machine learning continued to advance, mainly due to the breakthrough in hardware equipment. The computer processing power and storage capacity grew exponentially, enabling companies to store large amounts of data and process large amounts of data. Various companies and government agencies have successfully applied AI on a larger scale in different applications. In 2011, IBM question-and-answer system Watson defeated reigning champions Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings in the American quiz show  In 2016 and 2017, Alpha GO defeated Go player of 9 dan rank, Lee Sedol, and the world champion, Ke Jie, respectively. For the past 15 years, Amazon, Google, and other companies have gained substantial competitive advantages using machine learning. In addition to processing user data to understand consumer behavior, these companies continue to focus on computer vision, natural language processing, and many other AI applications. Many people believe that the current development of AI has slowed down to the point that we are near to face the third AI winter. Some think that there has been no breakthrough in the development of strong AI. Others believe that today enterprises focus on weak AI applications which suppress the growth of the entire AI industry. There are also people who criticize that the current\\xa0AI research is too centralized that is harming society. However, the current stock market is dominated mainly by the likes of Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, and so on. If the third AI winter were to come, not only will the AI industry stop moving forward, but the entire world will also face the next economic crisis.',\n",
       "  'Pull stock prices from online API and perform predictions using Recurrent Neural Network & Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) with TensorFlow.js framework Machine learning is becoming increasingly popular these days and a growing number of the world population see it is as a magic crystal ball: predicting when and what will happen in the future. This experiment uses artificial neural networks to reveal stock market trends and demonstrates the ability of time series forecasting to predict future stock prices based on past historical data. Disclaimer: As stock markets fluctuation are dynamic and unpredictable owing to multiple factors, this experiment is 100% educational and by no means a trading prediction tool. Explore the demo. There are 4 parts to this project walkthrough: 1. Get stocks data from online API 2. Compute simple moving average for a given time window 3. Train LSTM neural network 4. Predict and compare predicted values to the actual values Before we can train the neural network and make any predictions, we will first require data. The type of data we are looking for is time series: a sequence of numbers in chronological order. A good place to fetch these data are from\\xa0alphavantage.co. This API allows us to retrieve chronological data on specific company stocks prices from the last 20 years. The API yields the following fields: - open price -the highest price of that day - the lowest price of that day - closing price (this is used in this project) - volume To prepare training dataset for our neural network, we will be using closing stocks price. This also means that we will be aiming to predict the future closing price. This graph shows 20 years of Microsoft Corporation weekly closing prices. For this experiment, we are using\\xa0supervised learning, which means feeding data to the neural network and it learns by mapping input data to the output label. One way to prepare the training dataset is to extract the moving average from that time-series data. Simple Moving Average (SMA)\\xa0is a method to identify trends direction for a certain period of time, by looking at the average of all the values within that time window. The number of prices in a time window is selected experimentally. For example, let assume the closing prices for the past 5 days were 13, 15, 14, 16, 17, the SMA would be (13+15+14+16+17)/5 = 15. So the input for our training dataset is the set of prices within a single time window, and its label is the computed moving average of those prices. Let compute the SMA of Microsoft Corporation weekly closing prices data, with a window size of 50. And this is what we get, weekly stock closing price in blue, and SMA in orange. Because SMA is the moving average of 50 weeks, it is smoother than the weekly price, which can fluctuate. This graph is a simple Moving Average of Microsoft Corporation closing prices data to actual closing prices. We can prepare the training data with weekly stock prices and the computed SMA. Given the window size is 50, this means that we will use the closing price of every 50 consecutive weeks as our training features (X), and the SMA of those 50 weeks as our training label (Y).\\xa0 Next, we split our data into 2 sets, training and validation set. If 70% of the data is used for training, then 30% for validation. The API returns us approximate 1000 weeks of data, so 700 for training, and 300 for validation. Now that the training data is ready, it is time to create a model for time series prediction, to achieve this we will use\\xa0TensorFlow.js\\xa0framework. TensorFlow.js is a library for developing and training machine learning models in JavaScript, and we can deploy these machine learning capabilities in a web browser. Sequential model\\xa0is selected which simply connects each layer and pass the data from input to the output during the training process. In order for the model to learn time series data which are sequential,\\xa0recurrent neural network\\xa0(RNN) layer is created and a number of\\xa0LSTM cells\\xa0are added to the RNN. The model will be trained using\\xa0Adam\\xa0(research paper), a popular optimisation algorithm for machine learning.\\xa0Root mean square errorwhich will determine the difference between predicted values and the actual values, so the model is able to learn by minimising the error during the training process. Here is a code snippet of the model described above,\\xa0full code on Github. These are the\\xa0hyper-parameters\\xa0(parameters used in the training process) available for tweaking in the\\xa0frontend: - Training Dataset Size (%): the amount of data used for training, and remaining data will be used for validation - Epochs: number of times the dataset is used to train the model (learn more) - Learning Rate: the amount of change in the weights during training in each step (learn more) - Hidden LSTM Layers: to increase the model complexity to learn in higher dimensional space (learn more) Click the Begin Training Model button The model seems to converge at around 15 epoch. Now that the model is trained, it is time to use it for predicting future values, for our case, it is the moving average. We will use the\\xa0model.predictfunction from TFJS. The data has been split into 2 sets, training and validation set. The training set has been used for training the model, thus will be using the validation set to validate the model. Since the model has not seen the validation dataset, it will be good if the model is able to predict values that are close to the true values. So let us use the remaining data for prediction which allow us to see how closely our predicted values are compared to the actual values. This graph shows the green line which is the prediction of the validation data. Looks like the model predicted (green line) does a good job plotting closely to the actual price (blue line). This means that the model is able to predict the last 30% of the data which was unseen by the model. Other algorithms can be applied and uses the\\xa0Root Mean Square Error\\xa0to compare 2 or more models performance. Finally, the model has been validated and the predicted values map closely to its true values, we shall use it to predict the future. We will apply the same\\xa0model.predict\\xa0function and use the last 50 data points as the input, because our window size is 50. Since our training data is increment daily, we will use the past 50 days as input, to predict the 51st day. This graph shows the latest 50 days, which is the test data (blue line), and the predicted value (orange). There are many ways to do time series prediction other than using a simple moving average. Possible future work is to implement this with more data from various sources. With TensorFlow.js, machine learning on a web browser is possible, and it is actually pretty cool. Explore the demo on Github, this experiment is 100% educational and by no means a trading prediction tool. View source code on Github Hi!

       "  'We have been living in the digital era of the internet, that is evolving with each passing day and with the advancement in technology, the inhibiting issues of the modern age internet have been liberated with the amalgamation of Blockchain, AI and IoT. Since I have talked so much about these technologies, it time for me to move to the core of these technologies to tell you how this convergence can bring a change for a better world? So, without wasting much time, let begin! This blog will talk about How Blockchain, AI and IoT would come together to radiate the most recurring impact on the business industry? First, let talk about some stats in general. By 2020, global spending on IoT technologies is expected to reach $1.3 trillion. On the other hand, the AI software market is expected to reach %59.8 billion by 2025, while on the other side, the global market for Blockchain Development is predicted to be worth $3 trillion by 2024. Going by the stats, there is a huge scope that businesses can relate to. So, if you own a startup or an enterprise going by this technological mix would open horizons for your business in the near future. Let dig in and understand what Blockchain, AI and IoT can bring to the table? Before I talk about the actual convergence, let talk about Blockchain, AI and IoT in general. I am kicking off with blockchain since it has been the most talked-about technology among the rest. Blockchain has a synonym with technology evolution and how it has impacted industries from healthcare to supply chain to retail by adding a layer of security and transparency into their processes. It has been one of the most loved technologies in recent times for entrepreneurs. The major advantages that we look through Blockchain are: Though there have been technical recommendations to adopt and integrate blockchain in our existing business models, the adoption of blockchain could impose certain threats as there have been challenges faced by blockchain as a technology, let us understand what are they? Challenges in the existing Blockchain Model: The challenges imposed by blockchain could not be radiated for future implications and it has been said that it could be resolved with the convergence model of Blockchain, IoT and AI as mixing the capabilities of these radiating technologies could improvise the state of blockchain for better. Now let understand the AI model features and challenges: Artificial Intelligence(AI) or Machine Intelligence is the technology that makes machines smart enough to mimic human intelligence and perform tasks on their own. This cognitive ability to perform tasks on own has impressive features that have brought a paradigm shift in the business world  making everyone understand why investing in Artificial Intelligence is the need of the hour. Key Features of Artificial Intelligence are: There have been challenges that AI has been facing and the impact could be seen in the larger picture when businesses collaborate standalone with AI, let discuss the challenges faced by AI: These challenges possess a threat for business models integrating the power of AI alone in the long run. So, what should be the business solution for this problem in the long run?\\xa0 Confused right?\\xa0 The convergence of Blockchain and AI would serve the purpose? There have been claims that Blockchain and AI would improve security and scalability leading to the commercialization of business processes. In my previous article, I have talked about How Blockchain and AI Integration is Changing Business Landscape? Still, there is a long to streamline business operations through Blockchain and AI. Check out the blog for my deeper insights on Blockchain and AI. Meanwhile, let move on to IoT and how it has been revolutionizing the world?\\xa0 IoT:\\xa0 IoT is also known as the Internet of Things which is the interconnection of physical devices that are connected through a network to identify themselves to other devices through RFID, sensor technologies, wireless technologies, and QR codes. Key features that distinguish IoT from other competing technologies are: There have been challenges that IoT is facing and it is a possibility that the convergence of Blockchain, IoT and AI could resolve major prohibiting issues. Let look for now the incoming challenges faced by IoT: Conclusion: The convergence of Blockchain, IoT and AI: Now, we have talked about the challenges, key features of these three rampant technologies. The golden triad of Blockchain, AI and IoT have much more to offer if they are interwoven and interlinked together.\\xa0 Let see how they can be amalgamated together for better future implications: Artificial Intelligence or AI can be termed as intelligence that allows machines to learn and reason in ways that are possible only by humans. Combining this with the radiating powers of\\xa0 IoT and you have a gradient system that is variably more interesting than either one by itself. The mountains of data points captured and registered by IoT can be seeped and analyzed by Artificial intelligence to discover meaningful and decisive patterns that would be, at best, difficult for humans to discover and alter. Better yet, the algorithms should improve with time to improvise on the current trends in technology. On the other hand, Blockchain technology, which is useful much more than the basic field of bitcoin can be used to make unalterable, persistent, and searchable records or transactions, contracts and official documents. Combine these together and you can perceive a new view of the future: a world where data is gathered by multiple systems, analysed by artificial intelligence to take decisions on our behalf, which are then recorded and time-stamped on blockchain as a permanent record of decisions which are made and communicated on our behalf.

       "  'There is a trend in neural networks that has existed since the beginning of the deep learning revolution which is succinctly captured in one word: scale. The natural dimensions of scaling these models have been compute and data. Compute scaling has been a massive undertaking at every level of the stack, from hardware accelerators to high-level software tools, for more than a decade. Large datasets have become a key advantage in the new digital economy, and it has been the driver behind models that can ingest and make sense of such datasets. In most cases the best models are at the cutting edge of our ability to scale on these resources. This becomes a practical issue as predictions sometimes need to be computed at high volume with low latency, but generally the models that learn the best aren\\'t the fastest. The field of study that relates to tackling this issue is called model compression. There are many techniques, some feeling a little hacky like setting small weights to zero and inducing sparse data representations. Others seem more principled like knowledge distillation, where a trained heavy-weight model is used to \"teach\" a much smaller network, or another technique called conditional computation where a controller decides which parts of a network to activate for a given input sample. It\\'s an open question as to how much compressed models lose in generalizability versus the originally trained network. If you read the papers you\\'ll of course see that in the experiments the compressed models perform just as well or surprisingly even better than the original models on their evaluation sets. But one thing I\\'ve learned in deploying models in the real world is that it\\'s never the end of the story. The environment can always change under you, sometimes slowly and sometimes rather quickly. The road to truly intelligent and adaptive systems might rely on what I\\'ve been inspired by the old gods of creativity and genius to call model decompression. The principle is straightforward: when you detect your model drifting in its performance, add back some capacity in the compressed model and learn on the fly. This sounds like a stupid idea from a technical standpoint because the way we deal with model drift today is much more effective. We just retrain or continually train the big network and repeat the compression process when we want to ship out a new model. Understanding why that is the suboptimal thing requires a bit of imagination with respect to edge computing. The reason model compression gets any sort of real attention is because we want to deploy these amazing technologies without being bottlenecked by networks. Network communication is typically the slowest and worst resource to be limited by, so if you need a heavy cloud server to do all of your ML and send it back to a mobile phone or remote device you\\'re going to have a bad time with reliability and latency. Model compression enables us to ship these models and run them on-device with low latency and low power consumption. I\\'ll walk back on calling our current methods silly a bit because when the environment changes radically you can\\'t expect a hyperspecialized model to simply adapt itself completely. If that were true we would never need a heavyweight model to begin with. There is some recent work on using intermediate models, called \"teaching assistants\", to help build a hierarchy of distillation to help the student network learn better. Taking this to its logical end for solving model drift at the edge, it seems that the intermediate networks can sit on a spectrum of resource requirements between the teacher and the student. Of course for smaller drift this makes a lot more sense, and perhaps one could even get away with no new resources at all (besides compute power). It is all relative, and something that humans in the form of ML engineers shouldn\\'t be tuning themselves when they\\'re alerted that the models are suddenly regressing. It makes a lot more sense that we introduce new components to this system that help automate this process. There have been a lot of criticisms thrown at our distinction between a training and inference phase. The thought is that training should always be happening like in brains, not just one-and-done. This is somewhat related to the study of continual learners. Unfortunately this doesn\\'t easily fit with the hardware story. Training is assumed to be very compute intensive, and the situation is rather hopeless without hardware acceleration. But this isn\\'t always the reality: training from scratch is known to be compute intensive, but we may not need dozens or hundreds of passes over our training data to adapt to new situations. Perhaps it\\'s worth revisiting the idea of training at the edge with current hardware. These are hard problems to solve today for the edge because of the hard constraints on resources. They are much less encumbering in the cloud, so it\\'s a wonder why we don\\'t have systems that auto-tune themselves and constantly ingest data from a variety of streams. Well, we have them, but of the organizations I know that do this the size of their ML teams is in the dozens to hundreds. One big reason is just that building scalable data processing systems is still non-trivial. But the bigger reason is that our models are still hard to train, for a variety of reasons, and it involves a lot of people trying different ideas to make gains in performance. This makes sense in the age of ML where features are generated by hand. But deep learning has changed that, or at least it promised to. And we have shown in the past decades, especially our most recent one, that this does work. But most real-world scenarios haven\\'t had the benefit of some very bright scientists and years of research thinking about inductive biases and data preparation strategies. Scaling their efforts has resulted in things like neural architecture search, hyperparameter optimization, and transfer learning. These have also been proven to work internally at Google, so much so that it\\'s now available as a cloud service. With newer forms of unsupervised pretraining methods in different data domains, the canonical successes of deep learning may finally be realized for many real world problems across domains and industries. These are the foundational elements of our next-generation system. As of yet these elements are not integrated into one system. There are several reasons for why we haven\\'t gotten there which I will outline. Some of the parts seem incompatible. For instance, after finding an optimal architecture via neural architecture search, how does one then employ transfer learning from pretrained models? And is there software out there where you can store models and query them when you want to build a new one, retrieving the best one to use as a pretrained starting point? Do similar things exist for getting raw data into the optimal form for current networks to effectively learn from? Surely those algorithms exist with hyperparameter equivalents that should be tuned in conjunction with models? I expect in time we will solve some of these things, and it\\'s something that must be driven by an industry research lab with the expertise in both systems engineering and deep learning as a science. There is also a large cost to running such a system, ignoring the necessary upfront capital to build it. But cost is less interesting if we expand our view on the time dimension. Because everyone knows that compute costs will always trend aggressively downwards, it has been true for half a century now, it continues despite the end of Moore\\'s Law, and there is now an entire global economy pushing that advancement along. Cost is also less interesting because transfer learning promises to remove the bulk of necessary compute power. One only needs to train a good base model once and fine-tune it as many times as necessary with cost being orders of magnitude smaller. This evokes the application of another advanced technique in the area: federated learning. It is often the case that companies have proprietary data they don\\'t want to share. And yet they may also be hesitant to exploit that data due to the severe cost limitations on apply deep learning to it. But perhaps they would be more willing if we had our next-generation adaptive deep learning system coupled with the ability to do federated learning, that is, train locally (as in, on-premises inside a company\\'s network) and only report back gradients to the outside world. Concretely, this could enable multiple health records companies or law firms to jointly create the best model for their problems, leaving its true application downstream for fine-tuning on their specific problems where they don\\'t have to share anything about the model (and the other parties likely don\\'t care much for it anyway as it\\'s of only tangential value to them). Federated learning could drive the cost of even the initial pretraining models down further. Perhaps we need not wait for better compute hardware after all.',\n",
       "  'Artificial Intelligence, or \"AI\" means different things to different people, but they all concern the way women and minorities relate to technology, and how those technologies adapt to us  or don Our current relationship to AI is reminiscent of how the publishing industry used to sell books to women; romance novels, in particular. The formula was simple: put a woman in the path of an elite, mysterious professional and have her be swept off of her feet. Selling Romance These mystery men  surgeons, pilots, lawyers  were mostly inaccessible to women. Styled as dashing, charming and chivalrous, few women could connect with such sought-after specimens outside of escapist romance novels. Small wonder that stewardess and secretarial roles became sought after jobs. Proximity to old boy clubs, where husband material could be found, was in high demand. Until it wasn The 1960s brought book publishers an audience of women trailblazers on the work front. These emancipated women now had access to elite professions  as well as to the men who used to hold these roles. Readers bored by  dark, and handsome hero tropes needed something different from office-worker romances. Build a Better Idol The threat of potentially unsold books spurred publishers into action. What did they do? They invented the new romance genre,  romance. Featuring vampires, werewolves, vikings, and gods, the genre was marketed as an escape from regular human men bad jokes, bad breath or bad posture.  romance became a $100+ million annual grossing genre that helped the publishing industry dazzle its audience, without changing much. This razzle-dazzle marketing technique is well-known to those of us who work in tech. We seen the parade of tech vanguards and visionaries, and above all,  who are usually one  of men. But as with the downturn in traditional romances, once women got the lay of the land in tech, they started a wave of whistle-blowing that extended to tech\\'s venture-capital-industry shadow. Instead of books trying to sell a tired fantasy, the tech industry has billion-dollar IPOs on the line. Its new hero is a technology that promoted as de-emphasizing human behaviours: it\\'s called Artificial Intelligence. AI is hyped as being purely data-driven. In other words, it as far from error-prone human behavior as a vampire is from a dorky office-mate. Tech investors have embraced AI-driven everything. That means products, services, and systems are being rolled out globally to show this infatuation. But AI is not limited to experimental branches of technology. It touching many branches of everyday life in ways that we might not want or enjoy. It probably time to look at AI as if it an actual, intimate relationship we in. I a romantic, but AI algorithms have gone in the direction of an abusive relationship  minus the billionaire, the helicopter rides, and the safe word. Artificial Intelligence, the  Romance of Tech Facial recognition technology  a cornerstone of AI  has already had outsize effects on people lives. For those who are paying attention, AI is already showing its bad breath and poor manners.  Just look at the FaceID technology on the iPhoneX. Many were delighted that this lets you unlock and access call records, emails, and texts on your phone. However, among those\\xa0not\\xa0delighted were some iPhoneX users in China. Alternatively, let look at, say, Black people. They may avoid the iPhoneX, but many may not be able to avoid surveillance cameras using AI that performs consistently poorly on their group.  poor performance may mean police arresting you in error because their AI software misidentifies Black and other dark-skinned men, women and children. What if these failures don stop police from adopting these AI wholesale? If AI is a mirror of the past (and of its makers blind spots), we should care about how we may be stigmatized, stereotyped or harmed by AI algorithms. No accuracy guidelines is why Amazon  hiring algorithm had to be scrapped after it was found to exclude women from the hiring pipeline  just for being women. Men were not negatively affected by the Amazon AI hiring algorithm, and for some reason, no one noticed bias until\\xa0after\\xa0it affected potential candidates. These aren just far-off examples. In just the past year, I had a jarring run-in with AI algorithms, too. Promised a pre-approved credit line, I submitted a driver license scan, a passport photo and a  to a major credit card issuer only to be told that I  not be verified for some reason. No alternatives, in case of dysfunctional AI were in place. My driver license scan, passport information and selfie photo? Gone. All I had after giving my data over to some AI system was representatives who were unable to explain what their AI algorithms did or why it hadn worked. We should speak up about who may use our data to get closer to us than we want them to. In addition to questioning how our data is used, we can also: 1. Demystify technology.  I started a non-profit organization,\\xa0FrauenLoop, in Berlin, with the explicit goal of demystifying technology for women. Starting with a web development course, we expanded into data analysis, and then to software testing, machine learning, up to introduction to neural networks  that is what unsupervised computer learning, or Artificial Intelligence  is built upon. 2. Diversify Technology. Lack of diverse and global datasets is why FaceID couldn tell the difference between one Asian person and another. It why automated cars and some financial verification algorithms don always recognise dark complexions. It also one reason why Amazon hiring algorithm excluded\\xa0all\\xa0women when asked to choose between any man and one of them. 3. Demand Transparency.  We should question the role of AI algorithms in our selection for jobs, healthcare, promotions or financial products. Were they trained by someone who did not consider nor care about data for your demographic? Every Hero Needs a Code (of Conduct) We don all need retraining as data scientists; we just need to ensure that AI algorithms don become default decision-makers while their predictions and recommendations go un-questioned and barely understood. You wouldn believe that the vampire from the  novels is real and able to choose the best college candidates  but entrusting AI algorithms with key decisions without an error-checking process is basically the same thing. There is no such thing as bias-free, human-independent technology and the sooner we acknowledge this, the less likely we are to get punk by an algorithm. Creating ethical, privacy, and fair-use guidelines for AI products and services is critical.\\xa0And we should know better than to swoon like old-school romance readers over  AI. Ask any paranormal romance fan and they will tell you that underneath\\xa0every\\xa0type of hero there is, usually, a regular guy. Many tech educators are fighting back against the romanticization of AI organizations are ringing the alarm: For more info on tech education for women, made in Berlin, check out frauenloop.org',\n",
       "  'Every week, my team at Invector Labs publishes a newsletter to track the most recent developments in AI research and technology. You can find this week issue below. You can sign up for it using this link. Please do so, our guys worked really hard on this. The human brain remains the biggest inspiration for artificial intelligence(AI) research and technologies. Many of the modern techniques in areas such as deep learning draw inspiration from neuroscience. Furthermore, there are entire fields within AI dedicated to recreate elements of human cognition such as memory, common sense and, of course, consciousness. The biggest challenge is that we still know very little about the human brain. Neuralink is the newest, and not- so well-known, venture of tech provocateur Elon Musk. The ultimate goal of Neuralink is to create a human-machine interface that achieves symbiosis between human and machine intelligence. To get there, Neuralink first needs to have a deeper understanding of the human brain. This week unveiled some of their initial work and, not surprisingly, they are truly fascinating. Technologies like Neuralink can play an incredible roles in the next decade of AI.

       "  'In 2018, we all experienced a dramatic emergence of the tools, platforms and applications based on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. These technology tools not only transformed the internet and software industry, but it also had a massive impact on a wide range of verticals, including manufacturing, health, agriculture and automobile.\\xa0 AI-related and ML technologies will continue to grow in 2019 and the coming years. Organizations such as IBM, Facebook and Google are investing a lot of money and time in development and research of AI techniques to offer benefits to the users.\\xa0 Most of us wonder what transformation will AI bring in 2019. From the Gmail email response prompter to transcription of voicemails, automatic appointment calls, Alexa for smart homes and self-driving cars on the road, we had witnessed a lot in 2018. But the question is what changes are we going to experience in 2019 and 2020..\\xa0 We shall discuss some of the fantastic Artificial Intelligence trends to watch. Following are the artificial intelligence trends to watch out in 2019: Artificial intelligence depends on specialized processors, complementing the CPU. The advanced CPU models can also not enhance the speed of the AI training model.\\xa0The AI model requires additional hardware to solve complex mathematical problems to increase the speed of tasks, like facial recognition and object detection.\\xa0Chip manufacturers, including NVIDIA, ARM, Intel and Qualcomm will deliver specialized chips to enhance the speed of AI-based applications.\\xa0AI-enabled chips will be designed for particular use cases and scenarios related to natural language processing, speech recognition and computer vision. Industry-grade applications will soon depend on these chips to provide intelligence to consumers or end-users.\\xa0 Recently, facial recognition has been widespread for a lot of negative press releases, whether it is China\\'s SenseTime or Google winning the lawsuit.\\xa0But, this technology will continue to grow in 2019. Facial recognition is an AI-based technique that is introduced to identify an individual using patterns of their facial features and their digital image.\\xa02019 would witness an increased usage of facial recognition technology with high reliability and accuracy. For example, Facebook\\'s Deepface program is used for tagging friends and family in photos. Also, almost every smartphone now come up with a face lock.\\xa0 From advertising to shipping experience, facial recognition will continue to be used for biometric identification. Due to non-invasive identification and ease of deployment, this AI technology trend will continue to rise.\\xa0 Other use cases of Facial recognition include payment processing via security checks and law enforcement. The upcoming facial recognition techniques can also be used in the healthcare industry for clinical trials and medical diagnostics. Openwater, one of the portable medical imaging technologies, is breaking the boundaries that can read images from our brain. AI will meet IoT at the edge computing layer in 2019. We will witness more use cases of convergence of AI with IoT.\\xa0For instance, the concept of self-driving cars would not have become practical without the combination of AI and IoT. IoT-enabled sensors collect real-time data and AI models power decision-making programs. Deep learning algorithms help in taking actions and making decisions based on the data gathered by IoT sensors. Some of the actions include eye-tracking to enhance driver monitoring, route planning, self-direct move to a gas station when the car runs low on fuel or gas and natural language processing for voice commands.\\xa0\\xa0IoT is ready to become the significant driver of artificial intelligence in the enterprise. Edge devices will be equipped with AI-enabled chips based on ASICs and FPGAs.\\xa0 As artificial intelligence is gaining a lot of traction with each passing day, almost everyone comes up with a common question, i.e., \"Would AI take away jobs soon?\"\\xa0The answer is, \"it depends.\"\\xa0While artificial intelligence will take away jobs where resources will be scarce, it will also bring newer jobs with multiple skillsets.\\xa0No matter what is the answer, the topic is under discussion by various governments and the World Economic Forum. It is because the rise of AI applications will have a risk of widening skills gap and can create polarized societies.\\xa0Though automation may eliminate the need for jobs, there will always be a demand for jobs like teachers, caregivers, customer service executives and more.\\xa0Redistributive programs will be the focus of attention for lawmakers in 2019.\\xa0 One of the biggest challenges in building neural network models depends on selecting the right framework. Developers and data scientists have to choose the right platform from a plethora of options, including TensorFlow, Caffe2, Apache MXNet, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit and PyTorch.After a model is trained and assessed in a particular framework, it is difficult to port the trained model to another framework. It happens due to the lack of interoperability among neural network toolkits. To overcome this challenge, Facebook, Microsoft and AWS have partnered to develop Open Neural Network Exchange, that allows reusing trained neural network models across various frameworks.\\xa0 It will become a crucial technology for the industry in 2019.\\xa0 Modern infrastructure and applications generate log data which is captured for searching, indexing and analytics. The huge data sets obtained from the operating systems, application software, server software and hardware can be correlated to search patterns and insights.\\xa0After machine learning models are applied to such data sets, IT operations can transform from being reactive to predictive. When the potential of Artificial Intelligence is applied to operations, it will reconstruct the way infrastructure is handled. The application of AI and ML in DevOps and IT operations will offer intelligence to companies. It will help the ops team conduct an accurate and precise root cause analysis.\\xa0It is the reason why AIOps will become a focus in 2019. The convergence of AI and DevOps will benefit both enterprises and public cloud vendors.\\xa0 The AI trend that will change the ML-based models is AutoML. It will allow developers and business analysts to develop machine learning models that can solve complicated scenarios without undergoing the process of training ML models.\\xa0When using AutoML platform, business analysts can stay emphasized on the business problem rather than getting lost in the workflow and progress.\\xa0The platform can fit between custom ML platforms and cognitive APIs and deliver the right level of personalization without requiring developers to go through the complete workflow.\\xa0 Machine learning becomes complicated when the number of dimensions of data gets increased. Imagine you try to transcribe your voice into the text. The problem is aggravated several times.\\xa0However, deep learning is a technology behind self-driving cars, image recognition and voice control. With the emergence of both Google Home and Amazon\\'s Alexa, you may find a wide range of voice-based applications using natural language processing, an application of Deep Learning.\\xa0Therefore, we can witness increased interest in the next-generation of deep learning algorithms which can overcome complex problems, for example, interpretation of technology infrastructure issues.\\xa0 As we all know that the blockchain deals with challenges like scalability while AI has trust and privacy issues, these two technologies can be combined to resolve these challenges.\\xa0\\xa0 Powering decentralized marketplaces, blockchain can help AI algorithms to become more trustworthy and transparent. For instance, Enigma is a startup that provides a secure data marketplace that users can subscribe and access via smart contracts.\\xa0 The introduction of GDPR was the most hyped topic in 2018. We are expected to see more conversations related to policy and privacy in 2019 and 2020..\\xa0Most of us do not know how our digital information is being used over the internet. Facebook\\'s crisis over privacy has led to consciousness regarding the privacy of digital data.\\xa0It is the reason why legislators and countries will continue to view privacy policy as a crucial concern in 2019. Issues of the consent of usage of the digital ecosystem around Artificial Intelligence will be given immense importance and the laws developed around AI requires further understanding. Countries around the world will continue to work on initiatives to develop artificial intelligence regulations.\\xa0 From the AI trends mentioned above, it can be concluded that AI is not going to witness a decline any time soon. We will continue to see new AI trends with each passing year. If you are willing to implement any of these AI trends in your existing solution or you want to build an AI-based solution from scratch, our Artificial Intelligence experts can assist you and provide the right solution.

       "  \"Singapore is home to some of the best schools in the field of Computer Science, specifically\\xa0Artificial Intelligence. The\\xa0cutting edge research going on there is unparalleled. Colleges like Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and\\xa0National University of Singapore (NUS)\\xa0have a great reputation all over the world for their CS programs.\\xa0 An opportunity presented itself to me when I was in my college in SRMIST, Chennai, India. A Global Academic Internship Programme (GAIP) by Corporate Gurukul, which sends students interested/experienced in\\xa0Artificial Neural Networks and Big Data to NUS to study under world class faculty. I wasn't letting this pass, so I signed up for it, cleared the interview and got in!\\xa0 It was December 2018 and I was on my flight to Singapore ð\\x9f\\x87¸ð\\x9f\\x87¬. The\\xa0Academic Internship was very exciting because of it's thorough\\xa0syllabus covering the basics and advanced topics related to Artificial Neural Networks(ANN) and Big Data (more on these topics later).\\xa0In a span of 15 days we had to work on two projects trying to implement whatever that was taught in the lectures keeping in mind the business value of the project that was being developed.\\xa0 We covered ANN for the first 8 days, followed by Big Data in the remaining. ANN Lectures were delivered by\\xa0Dr. Lek Hsiang Hui,\\xa0Dr. Tan Wee Kek and\\xa0Dr. Wang Wei.\\xa0 Firstly, we had\\xa0Dr. Lek Hsiang Hui who gave us an introduction to Data Analytics. It was a really good insight and added value to my understanding of the same concept.\\xa0 Secondly, we had\\xa0Dr. Tan Wee Kek who presented the concepts of Machine Learning in a very intuitive manner, and I was able to grasp most of the concepts with ease. Things I understood and implemented: An artificial neural network is designed to function like the neurons in the brain. Lastly,\\xa0Dr. Wang Wei introduced us to topics revolving around Artificial Neural Networks. These topics were harder to understand with the level of Calculus involved but Dr. Wei did a great job at teaching us the basics. Here's everything that I learned and implemented: We had to present our Artificial Neural Networks Course Project two days after our final lecture. Those days went by really quickly with little or no sleep as me and my group mates hustled to finish our project called Quick Draw. We wanted to make something that has great scope for real-world implementation and helps the society.\\xa0Our program tracks the strokes of the user and gives an output predicting what the user is trying to draw in real-time. Quick Draw uses the existing Google's Dataset\\xa0of various labeled hand drawn images in the Numpy Array format. We downloaded the data of 4 classes (20,000 images each) and started training it with different algorithms. First we started off with SVM, then K-Means Clustering, then Feed-Forward Neural Network, then Convolutional Neural Network and finally Long Short-term Memory (LSTM).\\xa0We found out that CNN and LSTM gave us the highest accuracies. So we decided to use those two models and we made a front end for our project using OpenCV library which is basically taking input of our strokes from the keyboard. You can checkout the project\\xa0here. Now moving on to the\\xa0Big Data Course, the second one of our internship. This course was delivered by\\xa0Ravindra Kumar, or as we call him,\\xa0God of Linux. He helped us work on some really complicated linux commands, broke them down for us so that we find it easy. Here are the topics that I learned and implemented: After the lectures, we had to work on a\\xa0project\\xa0in which we set up a\\xa0three node cluster\\xa0deployed on a platform and managed using\\xa0Ambari. We had to do everything from scratch, set up\\xa0password-less SSH\\xa0between the three nodes, setup\\xa0Java, JDBC, Hadoop environments on the .bashrc file, creating a local repository, transferring data from the local repository to\\xa0HBASE\\xa0and then performing operations on that Data. We chose the book called 'Sherlock' from the Gutenberg Library and\\xa0performed Word-Count and MapReduce programs on it. Every step of the project was done mostly through shell commands which was really cool and helped us understand the working of Linux commands, when and where to use them.\\xa0 It was a\\xa0really enriching experience\\xa0to learn from the best in the world and work on projects under their guidance. I also would like to\\xa0thank the Teaching Assistants(TA) for the course Puru Sharma and\\xa0Devvrit Khattri, they were always there to help us out with any difficulty that we would face and help us overcome it.

       "  \"Roughly three and a half years ago, we started working on Tara AI, however the genesis of the story begins much earlier. It all began when I had the good fortune of meeting Syed Ahmed in freshman year of college, our company current co-founder and CTO. Everyday, I continue to meet with founders and hopeful entrepreneurs that are starting companies with enormous potential, and I find that the first hurdle they have to cross, is finding a partner-in-crime. I truly believe that going about building a company is an arduous journey, and its nearly impossible to build a lasting high-growth company without a co-founder (kudos to those who have achieved this as single founders). I also come to realize, that if you can convince another human being to invest all of their time and energy in building this  that doesn currently exist, then other obstacles start to become easier (even if it by a factor of 0.0001%). It was the year 2006, Facebook had just started rolling out to universities and you needed an invite with a .edu email address to get  Nokia flip-phones were a thing. So was watching movies on your iPod Nano. I was 16 and in freshman year (Finance), and I happened to meet Syed (Mechanical Engineering) through a student extracurriculars club. Over the next few years, we engaged in long discussions about the process of selecting a major and the usefulness of a 4 year degree, along with whether or not we were going to remain in the Middle East.\\xa0 Eventually, in 2011, I had to cross the hurdle of asking him to join me on an adventure of starting our first company. Now, looking back, I am attempting to build a framework around the process of finding the right co-founder. One thing I continue to observe is the rise of founder networking events, and apps that promise  dating I find that some of the best places to look for a partner in crime continue to be in your own existing networks. Going through YCombinator with Tara AI, we found friends and companies that have followed a similar framework. Platzi founders, Christian Van Der Henst and Freddy Vega were competitors when they first decided to join forces. The Equipment share co-founders were part of a faith-based commune in Missouri. There are several examples of companies I continue to observe that have long-lasting meaningful co-founder relationships, and they met years (and years) before starting their companies.\\xa0 Asking people you know if they are willing to jump ship or drop off their career trajectory, to build something that doesn exist, is easier said than done. However, some of the most risk-averse people may end up surprising you by saying yes to embarking on the co-founder journey. The key, is to de-risk the value proposition of your business and set a milestone that can be achieved in a short amount of time. This may include finding a set of target customers, building an MVP or making your first sale. In my case, after graduation, Syed and I went our separate ways. Syed started a career in big data and mechanical engineering with a postgrad from QUT, and I was in finance and data analysis. He was insistent that I find a set of target customers (and close them) before he would agree to work on Tara AI full-time.\\xa0  built on Facebook's open graph will not last  amazes me how enterprise infrastructure continues to be filled with security vulnerabilities.  much of software development is a repeatable process and majority of functioning code in applications can be attributed to open-source. These were a few of Syed predictions/observations in 2006, before they became obvious to the technology industry. I now made it a rule in life to seek out individuals that spot anomalies or early patterns invisible to others, as colleagues, investors or co-workers. I admit, early on, I was dismissive to several of Syed observations. However, over time, by meeting successful founders I learned that those that predict the future, often end up building it. During undergrad (and immediately after) Syed and I were both struggling to make ends meet in our respective fields. I graduated summa cum laude, and Syed had two postgrad degrees, yet we were both struggling to find jobs that paid livable salaries in 2010 (it was right after the financial crisis and companies were rarely hiring for entry-level roles). Somehow, we found ways to earn on the side. Syed started learning programming and he discovered that with $200 we could test our ideas with customers through simple landing pages. Seeing that every fresh graduate was having issues finding jobs, we decided to launch a quick solution and called it Gradberry. In a few days of launching a landing page, we had 2,000 students from 40 universities signed up on a waitlist to find entry-level jobs. We did a lot more with a lot less. Companies are not built overnight; it is a long and arduous journey through customer development to get to product-market fit. Most companies fail because founders give up. The emotional journey can take an immense toll, which is why I believe conviction is an extremely under-appreciated personality trait.\\xa0 To continue to have faith in your idea (and pivot as necessary) takes an almost  level of effort. It continues to baffle me how individuals with conviction in their beliefs, can move mountains. As a founder, you need to focus on being relentless and continue to prove your market hypotheses. I remember our Y Combinator interview only rolled around after we had unsuccessfully applied twice. After the interview, I was convinced we didn get in. We had applied late (several weeks after the deadline) and so our odds were a miniscule 0.5%. Syed, on the other hand, was convinced we were the right founders to tackle the problem, and that our acceptance call was a few hours away. His intuition proved correct, and the rest is history. Of course, getting into YCombinator was only the first hurdle, and we continued to face adversity as we set out on the journey. However, relying on a core set of beliefs and having a deep conviction about our theses, enabled us to keep chugging along.\\xa0 My thesis: if your potential co-founder displays at least three of the above four traits - 1) there is an existing cordial relationship built on trust, 2) they can spot trends invisible to others, 3) they hustle hard and 4) have conviction in their beliefs, take the leap. Propose and ask if they will quit their day job, quit a degree program or even move to another continent to start the next world-changing company.\\xa0 The worst they can do is say no! P.S. Since founding our current company, Syed and I took another giant leap of faith and are now married. He continues to challenge me everyday. Thank you to David Keith and Nikhil Gopalani for reading through drafts of this (and to Syed Ahmed for adding accuracy to my memory). \",\n",
       "  'No longer does artificial intelligence only exist in sci-fi movies and books about dystopian futures. It in the here and now, continuously transforming the way in which we live and work.\\xa0 Many of us interact with AI on a daily basis - we call on Siri to give us directions to nearby coffee shops or ask Alexa to order us goods on Amazon. AI is also seamlessly supplementing and enhancing operations across a variety of industries and increasingly disrupting internal company functions.\\xa0 However, at the same time, it also becoming more and more apparent where AI still has limitations that prevent it from fully replicating human behavior.\\xa0 This article discusses both the real-world potential and current shortcomings of artificial intelligence, delineating between what is true today and what is still a myth. Let dig in. How Is AI Impacting Different Industries? Advances in AI impact industries in different ways depending on the nature of the underlying processes and activities. Those that rely heavily on repetitive tasks and data analysis are ripe for disruption as modern AI can learn to recognize patterns and make sound judgments within predictable environments. From inventory management to sales, retail companies are using AI today to support both online and brick-and-mortar operations. For example, IBM Watson equips online retailers with AI-facilitated order management and customer engagement capabilities. In Japan, SoftBank opened a retail location in 2016 that was staffed primarily by humanoid robots that can listen and respond to human speech.\\xa0 In the banking world, AI is augmenting both front and back office procedures. From underwriting and collection to cybersecurity and authentication, artificial intelligence is already used in many capacities and is expected to continually overtake functionality in the space.\\xa0 McKinsey & Co. recently released an analysis (see chart above) in which they calculated how much value AI could potentially create across different sectors. As you can see, the firm estimates value creation to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars for many industries. At the top, already discussed in this article, is the Retail space which is seeing wide scale, transformation at the hands of AI. Not only will future AI automate physical tasks, such as stocking shelves and managing checkout lanes, but it will also optimize analytics, marketing, and sales, especially with respect to eCommerce. Second in terms of potential sheer value creation is the Transport and Logistics sector where so much time is spent processing invoices, consolidating data, and scheduling across a variety of stakeholders. Through machine learning and natural language processing, AI will be able to automate all of these activities more accurately than human personnel in less time. Similarly, the Travel sector, which McKinsey predicts could see close to $400B in value creation, also depends heavily on logistical coordination and data analyses. And with chatbot technology improving, it won be long before customer service in this space is primarily performed by digital AI and humanoid robots.\\xa0\\xa0 Also near the top is the automotive industry which will change significantly with AI-powered autonomous vehicles. Companies like Google and Uber are pouring money into self-driving car technology that will be able to assess driving conditions in real-time and make consistently safe decisions. With human drivers out of the equation, roads will be safer, traffic will disappear, and commuting time will be much more productive. Overall, there is no shortage of use cases describing how AI is transforming various sectors and industries. Now, we dive into how AI is impacting internal company functions. How Is AI Impacting Various Functions Within Companies? From talent acquisition to finance and accounting, many core processes within the average corporation will also see major change at the hands of artificial intelligence. Many people don realize that most large companies today use Applicant Tracking Systems to manage job postings, schedule interviews, and screen resumes. These systems are able to sift through thousands of CVs per day and filter out unqualified candidates based on pre-programmed criteria.\\xa0 Companies are also replacing human customer service reps with chatbots that can respond appropriately to questions and address concerns. Additionally, marketing automation has exploded recently with AI leading the charge on where and when to distribute online ads based on customer behaviors on the internet. Finance and accounting departments all over the country are also being augmented by AI that can digest massive datasets in a fraction of the time it takes human workers. Some auditing firms are even using AI to assess contracts and perform risk assessments.\\xa0 With all of the ways AI is currently changing our world, it easy to forget that there are still limitations with modern AI that we have yet to overcome. Below, we discuss a few of the bigger challenges facing artificial intelligence developers. What Are Some Limitations With Modern AI? Firstly, AI requires tremendous amounts of data in order to be adequately trained to perform according to its design. In many cases, existing datasets aren large enough and don contain enough information for AI to learn how to function correctly. When this happens, humans have to spend thousands of hours labeling objects that are then fed to AI so that it can begin to build a knowledge base. Another limitation is that artificial intelligence reflects the biases of its programmers and any bias embedded within datasets. Because AI functionality is so dependent on human intervention, it is very difficult to completely separate the two and ensure that AI isn created with core biases. There is also the  box challenge which refers to our limited ability to decipher and understand how AI arrives at decisions and judgments. As models and algorithms grow more complex, it becomes harder to pinpoint what may have caused a specific action. As a result, it is difficult to assign accountability in certain situations. AI also has trouble transferring learning from one experience to another, something humans are quite adept at doing. Because AI today relies heavily on predictable circumstances and recognizable patterns, it can only really function well in one type of capacity unless it is re-trained which is, again, resource intensive. Examples of Public AI Failures As a result of the limitations discussed above, we have witnessed a number of ways that artificial intelligence has failed to perform, some humorous and others more serious.\\xa0 Last year, Facebook shut down two chatbots, Bob and Alice, who developed their own incomprehensible language amidst a negotiation involving hats, books, and balls. The hope for the bots was that they would eventually be able to converse with humans. In 2016, Microsoft Tay Twitter bot was decommissioned 16 hours after its launch as it began posting offensive content similar to what it was receiving from trolls in the Twittersphere. Since Alexa launch in 2014, there have been a number of examples of the device incorrectly interpreting commands (or non-commands) from both adults and children. In January 2017, a news anchor on TV said  love the little girl saying,  ordered me a dollhouse which then triggered devices within earshot of the TV to also place dollhouse orders! In Arizona, one of the more public and tragic examples of AI failure came when a self-driving Uber vehicle struck and killed a pedestrian crossing a street with her bike. After months of exciting press about how autonomous cars would change the world, the event served as a sober reminder that artificial intelligence still has a long way to go. What Do You Think? For most, advances in AI are incredibly exciting as the technology has the potential to truly impact our world for the better. For others, it hard to trust a non-human being that is designed to live and think like we do.',\n",
       "  ' think there a home for your talents. And that home is in D.C. That was the last thing I wanted to hear. I lived in London at the time, bouncing between stories as a tech reporter and projects with startups based in London Tech City. I wanted nothing more than to stay and make it work in the city I had fallen in love with. And I really wasn keen on moving back to the city where I spent my college years. Although I loved my time in D.C., I felt burned out by the end. By contrast, I loved living in London and was learning so much in my role as a reporter. I was being paid (albeit badly) to learn about things like self-driving cars, data ownership after death, the role of apps in aid relief and\\xa0a feared digital dark age. I hadn considered these concepts before; now, my job was to find experts with deep technical insights and interview them about their creations. I loved learning about tech, but how could I do that in DC? Like many, I disassociated D.C. from tech. I saw its economy as a little more than a one-stop political shop. Six years after that friend told me that D.C. was the next best step for me, I saw how correct she was. I evolved from a freelance tech reporter to working as part of a fully remote team for a Silicon Valley-based SaaS startup to an analyst studying\\xa0indirect bias in ML algorithms\\xa0and learning to code at free meetups  all from inside the Capital Beltway. Those of us in #dctech know that while we far from Silicon Valley, D.C. has its own advantages. In fact, it been rated\\xa0the #1 city for women in tech for the fifth year in a row. It also the city\\xa0where the pay gap is smallest, and women fill 39 percent of the city tech jobs  far above the industry average. As for me, D.C. is the city where my career came full circle. I first moved here back in the mid-aughts as a liberal arts major at\\xa0Catholic University. Eager for a fresh start somewhere else, I moved to London post-graduation to\\xa0earn my MSc\\xa0and start my career in London. Since returning to D.C. five years ago, I leapfrogged forward due to #dctech. In 2014, I wrote a series of articles\\xa0profiling DMV-based startups\\xa0for Europe Web Summit. In 2016, I helped the D.C.-based\\xa0Women Startup Challengehosted by\\xa0Women Who Tech\\xa0launch their first venture capital competition for women-led startups in London. In 2017, I started learning about AI and contributing to\\xa0The Diplomatic Courier, a Virginia-based magazine covering the future of work. And as an analyst for\\xa0GetApp, a\\xa0Gartner\\xa0company, I spent the last three years researching and writing about how various technologies are used within small and midsize businesses. I covered\\xa0robotics for bricklaying, semantic analysis for marketing, blockchain for supply chains, and\\xa0automation in accounting. Throughout my #dctech career, I been given the time, space, and encouragement to learn topics like explainable AI,\\xa0ML algorithms, and implementing data in a microservices architecture. It content that my younger self thought I was incapable of understanding, because I wasn a  person. I see now that I created a false binary. I met several women in the D.C. tech scene who learned to code, visualize data and direct product lines\\xa0after earning liberal arts educations. As a result, they approach their work through a more holistic lens. When you consider how your code will impact users at the outset, you more likely to spot bugs along the way. I been in tech for close to seven years and spent all of them far from the Golden Gate Bridge. There has been something special about working in two cities  London and D.C.  and growing my career alongside their tech scenes. I learned a crucial skill working in both cities:\\xa0Start with a product impact on end users. It a sadly rare strategy that hasn failed me so far, especially as tech enters a new era where ethics are top-of-mind. This thoughtful approach epitomizes #dctech, and I thrilled to be part of it.',\n",
       "  \"Whether you see the glass as half full or half empty, I think we can both agree, sometimes it makes sense to just fill the damn cup. And that the focus of today article, part two in our series on Existential Risk. If you missed that, check that out here before continuing. And now that you sufficiently depressed, let take that discomfort and channel it towards something productive, solutions. A quick recap, the seven deadly apocalyptic horsemen: And now the all-important question, how to tackle these seemingly insurmountable issues. If a billionaire or a bold company trying to cure cancer could accidentally wipe out most all  humanity, how do we prepare for the eventual altruism that could kill us all? This will depend on the proliferation and cost of the technology, but it seems obvious to assume genetic engineering and biotech will become increasingly democratized cheaper, easier, faster This has certain advantages: individuals everywhere have the ability to counteract wrongs and keep an eye on the status quo. And yet, like a mass murderer in a Texas town filled with\\xa0.45s, the idiot with the gun always gets off a few shots before someone drops him with a well-placed double tap Biotech bullets spread much faster. A moratorium on genetic engineering seems equally unlikely, the promises are just too great. So, what do we do? Are these technologies safer hidden in some lab, or open-sourced for all to see? Then again, look at the public outcry against GMOs, primarily due to misinformation. Is involving the public in something as important as our collective defense against the unintended consequences of gene-editing really a good idea? Questionable, at best. But most countries and many companies will want to capitalize on the most transformative industry of this coming century. So, nuclear anti-proliferation strategy isn going to work. This club is too easy and too important to be a member of. An initial framework: Step 1) An international think tank: Get the smartest biotech (and related) minds together and incentivize them to brainstorm unintended consequences and possible synthetic bio risks, creating a risk index of all forms of genetic and biological research, to be used later in randomized monitoring. Step 2) An international standard MUST be implemented threat of retaliation for any who violate the terms certain controversial areas as chemical/biological/viral weapons and gene drives banned and unlike the social media free-for-all, companies and countries are held MASSIVELY responsible for the consequences of their actions.\\xa0 Step 3) Creation of a biotech-specific investigative journalism organization dedicated to uncovering problems with the industry and bring the darkness to light. NOTE: This is anything but a complete plan, but as the scariest and most probable existential risk, it a tough nut to crack. At least terrorism is more straightforward. But, it also suffers from many of the same issues listed above. There are a few saving graces, chief among them being reduced resources and predictability. Even if the Saudi Royal Family largest funder of terrorism worldwide dedicated their entire estimated $1.4T net worth to the pursuit of bioterrorism, that only 0.65%  of the $215T wealth of the world. And there are a lot fewer folks to worry about and ways for things to go wrong. Unfortunately, even metal detectors in schools and sports stadiums have proven inadequate at stopping attacks. Would bioweapon detectors be any more effective? A few\\xa0ideas: Source: CNN Step 1) SSRIs have been implicated in nearly 86% of school shootings (here's more info with our interview with Dr. Bill Walsh), and given the fact that no testing is done prior to prescription, this seems a good place to start. And it would decrease gun crime/school shootings seems like an obvious win. Step 2) The trickier part of the problem are true psychopaths. It only takes one monster to engineer a super virus, and vaccines can take months to develop and mass-produce. If costs come down, it fair to assume the mass production part is as genetic/pharma 3D printers would be easily distributed, likely in every pharmacy. It even possible everyone owns their own one day. But that only half the battle. We need either: to be able to develop vaccines cures faster, or we need sufficient immunity biological resilience survive as yet uncreated/imagined diseases and weapons. It almost impossible to predict all possible failure modes, so speedier drug/vaccine development is probably our only option combined with distributed gas-mask-esque protection. For my money, I want several international think tanks competitively funded (or something akin to the XPRIZE) with the goal to reach the one or two day mark for diagnosis and vaccine development after disaster strikes. A sufficiently catchy superflu covers most of the world in about a week. Time is ticking. Step 3) In addition to the aforementioned think tanks in collaboration with the threat think tanks from #1 incentives for private market solutions need to be addressed. The market viability is currently too early, no one willing to pay for prevention until it too costly to avoid doing so. This is something governmental venture arms should invest heavily in, seeding the companies that could save all of us. Governments have proven ineffective at reigning in the effects of climate change, or our untenable CO2 emissions. This is the tragedy of the commons working its awful game theory. Everyone acts in their own immediate self-interest because everyone else is, and the pains of inaction are small, at least for the time being. To build a sustainable future, we have to embrace technological solutions to reduce emissions: more efficient farming, electric vehicles, renewable energy; while cutting back on overall consumption.\\xa0 If we already at the carrying capacity total amount of resource extraction our planet can sustain 3rd world countries to match our level of wasteful opulence will doom all of us, even if their economies and infrastructures are greener and more renewable than ours. The fact is, we make and consume too much shit. But, there an answer, and it doesn have to suck. Top-down approaches: Step 1) Courtesy of Douglas Rushkoff: Invert dividends and capital gains tax rates. Today, capital gains are ~10% and dividends taxed at the much higher income tax percentage. This incentivizes companies investors aim for growth at all costs, profits be damned.\\xa0 An economy predicated on growth consumes more and more as it destroys everything around it. By inverting tax rates, companies thus investors be more focused on sustainable business growth/practices. Apple wouldn need an iPhone to wear out every two years, or to slow down your OS to make you upgrade. Instead of an economy of one-and-done, it would incentivize a longer term, more minimalist existence where everyone wins, profits, and less shit ends up in the landfills of life. For more, see this interview. Step 2) Courtesy of Jarl Jensen: Eliminate subsidies on fossil fuels, cars and high emission industries and create subsidies for development/deployment of renewables. This one is pretty straightforward and universally applicable. Renewables are already on par price-wise with fossil fuels and coal in most areas of the world. A little extra push makes the pieces topple faster and drives us towards a sustainable future. If additional subsidies were created for other greener businesses: clean meat (animal agriculture is responsible for ~13-18% of emissions on how you measure and who you source even than global transportation), electric vehicles, net-zero construction, etc we be well on our way to mitigating worse of climate change. Wild cards: Carbon tax yet to work/be implemented but may in fact prove necessary. Bottom-up approaches: Step 1) Local agriculture/coops: The farther your food travels, the greater the carbon footprint and chance of spoilage/waste (which is approximately 24% of all food).\\xa0 The future of farming the possible exception of lab-grown meat, due to the value of scale local. City governments would do well to incentivize local farming, both creating jobs at home, reducing dependence on foreign forces and greatly reducing emissions. Step 2) Local tax hikes on high emission industries/products can ice this cake. Many initiatives are almost impossible on a global or even national basis, but municipalities and states have the ability to pass hard laws and bills that larger legislatures cannot. Some states are already leading the way and more will follow as consumers demand action. For all its faults, mutually assured destruction (MAD), has been a relatively successful strategy, despite many near catastrophes. On the whole, the world has done a good job mitigating at least preventing war up to this point. But, the spread of nuclear power makes this harder daily; much like a country filled with guns, more isn merrier. The progression towards renewable energy and away from nuclear the accidents at Fukushima a positive development, at least from the prospect of nuclear war, but greater efforts MUST be made at disarmament, especially among mutually hostile countries: US/Russia, Pakistan/India, etc But power is rarely given up, so more stringent monitoring procedures need to be implemented to prevent accidental leakages of technology/weapons, etc For my part, I like to see overhauls of missile command systems.\\xa0 Twitter would seem to suggest otherwise. The consensus among AI researchers is there no consensus on if/when we achieve superhuman AI. Assuming we will necessary assumption as not doing so would be like riding the Titanic without lifeboats or a vest begs the question: how the heck can we contain and/or control the all-powerful mystery that is AI? Thankfully, more and more AI researchers are working on this very problem today because they terrified of the implications. The best theory we come up with is robust value alignment, ie building artificial intelligences in line with human values and morals.\\xa0 This is problematic at best. What exactly are human values? Sharia Law? The 10 Commandments? Hammurabi code? The US Constitution?  If anything, assigning a set of values for an AI to follow is an exercise in folly. HP didn break any laws when they made Hitler death camp punch cards Well, we could try to have AI learn our values through observation, but data biased and we even worse. Or, we could hope a superintelligence would just ignore us, but then again, we accidentally step on ants all the time, and kill the ones who crawl into our homes. So, what can we ants do? The best approaches I seen involve either: limiting the capabilities of AI systems again, seems impossible given the risk/reward ratio and tragedy of the commons problem discussed earlier, let alone being able to predict bugs/failures counter-defensive AI, ie fantasy sports for society. I sure can cover LeBron James or stop a Steph Curry 3-pointer, but with other elite athletes (or AIs) playing on my behalf, at least there a fighting chance. Step 1) International regulations on proper development/containment of AI systems. The last thing we need is another NSA-esque leak where XYZ government or corporation accidentally release the end-of-times source code to anyone with an internet connection. Software is pretty easy to repurpose. Step 2) Sizable defense budget allocations to a non-governmental think tank/initiative focused on threat detection/forecasting. The only way to avoid disaster in the uber-exponential world of AI advancement is to plan for failure LONG before it happens. Two seconds is an eternity in ones and zeroes. It took a dozen terrorists, $500,000 and a few months of planning for Al-Queda to fly 747s into the World Trade Center. The world will never be the same. And yet today, any idiot can buy a drone and attempt to take out a jet or blow up a building, all from the comfort of their couch. Drones are scary, but autonomous drone weaponry is downright terrifying as costs drop and access rises. It only takes one country to develop said tech before others feel forced to play catch up.\\xa0 It nearly impossible to shoot down  suicide bomb  drone. And to date, robust anti-drone solutions have proven ineffective. Democratized mass murder is something humanity CANNOT afford to let happen, there no way to put the cat back into the bag with 3D printers, global supply chains and open-source tech. We NEED international efforts, now, before it is too late, with 1st-strike retaliation against any country or company found to be in violation of the accords. I and many others I spoken with are worried anything less would ultimately prove insufficient. In theory, easy money towards monitoring, fundamental research and design of asteroid path-altering technologies. It doesn really matter who does this, or why they do. We all on this little blue spaceship together. Unfortunately, every country hopes another will do the job for them. In the US, we massively slashed NASA budget and people question the value of space and space exploration. That may mean international agreements are needed to ensure sufficient funding and advancement in the all-important space-missile defense system for all of us. This would be ideal for an ultra-billionaire to start a foundation around hint, hint Jeff and Elon. Existential risks are a tough nut to crack. The list and suggestions above are by no means complete, a million challenges lie around the corner of every idea. But we don need perfect solutions to get started, just basic frameworks and smart, committed folks working towards the perfect good. And in a lot of areas, we have that already. And in a lot of ways, that you guys. Here where I ask for your help. I don have the answers, not even close. I just want to get the conversation started. How could we make these plans more robust and idiot-proof, because that what it will take. In the game of survival, it pays to rig the deck. Any great ideas?

To quote Sheila Jasonoff from her book,\\xa0The Ethics of Invention\\xa0(See what I did there?): I want to talk about email tracking as such a technology. The story about Superhuman broke this week. The firm email client did, apparently, cross a boundary. The product had a tracking capability which meant that a sender could see a recipient rough location and online status, without opt-in or opt-out. But understand that elements of this capability are now foisted on us across the board. Superhuman was far from unique. Add-ons like Mailtrack and Boomerang have provided similar email tracking capabilities for close to a decade. Messengers like Signal, WhatsApp and iMessage also give away the recipient status information. Superhuman response has been rapid and significant. The firm put a moratorium on that particular technology while they figure out what the non-Faustian bargain should be. (I offered Rahul, the CEO,\\xa0some typo-ridden suggestions\\xa0about what a product fix might look like.) The reality is that we are all in a process where we figure out positive-sum arrangements for these enhancing technologies. The technologies will shape our norms, yes. But our norms should also shape the technologies. Incidentally, you may wonder what kind of tracking happens on emails sent by\\xa0Exponential View? Well, in the case of this newsletter, every single recipient is on here via a double-opt-in. You have selected to receive the newsletter and confirmed you wanted to receive it.\\xa0 In common with virtually every other newsletter, our mailing platform provides us with operational data that includes which users opened the mail, and which links they clicked on. We use this data for operational reasons. Most commonly, we use it to track open and click rates. If we see these changing, usually declining (!!), we can make course corrections. Often a declining open rate means we are being caught by spam filters, and need to take action. Sometimes a declining open rate means that I started to bore you, and we need to shake things up. We have also drilled down into per-user open rates to understand cohort behaviours. This helps us to talk to you about improving\\xa0Exponential View.\\xa0 We also used open rate information as a way of identifying the most engaged readers. These users have become eligible for perks like early-access copies to new books or exclusive invites to events and conferences. Many hundreds of you have benefitted from this in the past few years. Of course, today those occasional goodies are now\\xa0concentrated on members of our Premium tier. We don provide an opt-out for tracking these metrics. It is essential operating data for us.

       "  \"What is it about the word automation that makes some perk-up while others cringe? According to Erik Brynjolfsson, author of Race Against the Machine and The Second Machine Age, automation simply means one fewer job than there used to be, with the same amount of output. For example a tax preparer can get automated away by TurboTax and no longer be able to find work. An assembly line worker can get automated away by a robot. Hordes of attorneys are now displaced by software in the legal discovery process, where an algorithm can search and classify thousands of documents in minutes which used to take dozens of lawyers weeks to accomplish. The common thread is the emerging digitalization or automation of what used to be manual, human-driven tasks. A recent report shows that almost 50% of jobs will be automated within the next 10-20 years. In a recent public health study by the UK government the combined costs from worklessness and sickness absence amounts to over  annually (about $125bn USD). The results show that it is healthy for people to be in  work than to be out of work. Good work means having not only a work environment that is safe but also having a sense of security, autonomy, good line management and communication within an organization. Besides automation risk to job security and income there is a moral and ethical case for greater action. Advances in hardware and software mean it possible to automate more. It's getting easier and quicker to automate white-collar jobs today than ever before. Technological advances in hardware, software/AI all make this possible and irreversible. Think of the airline staffers whose job checking in passengers has been taken by self-service kiosks. For the hackers among us, there is even a Y Combinator-backed tech startup that provides crowdsourced app development-as-a-service (I have no connection or relationship to them). You can build your own startup without needing a tech co-founder or even knowing how to code. It uses machine learning to identify the best packages for a given feature set based on what has historically been used with that relevant framework. In a way this seems inevitable. How many apps are built on a daily basis where the same tech stack or development problem has been solved thousands of times already? This takes productivity to another level but at what cost to the developers whose jobs may be displaced due to this crowdsourced approach to developer work allocation? This is only the beginning. Productivity gives us a sense of usefulness and well-being but increasingly at the cost of cheaper labor. More middle-class workers are getting left behind and starting over mid-career being unable to relearn or develop new relevant skills in time. Some parents with young children already worry that robots will take all potential jobs for their children in the near future. But how bad is it really? To see how likely your job is at risk of being automated run a job search on the Will Robots Take My Job website. With data taken from the Bureau of Labor Statistics augmented with its own internal quantitative poll you may be surprised. Out of over 700 occupations, here are the top twenty most at-risk for automation: For example Accountants and Auditors have a 94% probability of being replaced by software and AI in the next couple decades: You notice a common pattern to the jobs that are in danger of being automated--they are mainly based on a routine. In fact according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Routine Cognitive (i.e. accountants, lawyers) and Routine Manual (i.e. assembly line workers, watch repairers) jobs are on the decline. There is nothing innately wrong with routine. Some of our most rewarding experiences can be routine-driven such as repairing a gadget, fixing a car or even chopping wood. Routine work gets us into our flow state where we  into the zone You felt flow when you performing an activity and get fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, total involvement, and enjoyment. Flow is characterized by complete absorption in what one does, and a resulting loss in one's sense of space and time. But what if your livelihood and ability to pay your bills depend on that routine job that is increasingly in danger of being automated? Bliss can quickly turn into buzzkill. The probability of automation does not necessarily equal the probability of job loss. Just because a job can be automated doesn mean that it will. Successful companies will figure out the right balance of human and digital labor to keep a healthy and motivated workforce. This will require deeper thinking about the problem that you are trying to solve. The cost and productivity incentives will drive more companies to pursue digital labor. This time is now to reimagine your occupation and decide how you can continue to provide value, gain personal autonomy and future-proof your source of livelihood.\",\n",

       "  'Serial entrepreneur\\xa0Andrew Hoag\\xa0had a huge frustration. At previous businesses he run, employee purchases were always a big struggle. Whenever one of his employees needed to buy something, he had to either hand over his credit card or convince the employee to file for reimbursement. Then there was all the work involved in keeping track of who bought what, why, when, etc.  realized that, as an engineer, I have better tools to keep track of my source code than I do my money, Andrew says. He decided to build a tool to fix the problem, and\\xa0Teampay\\xa0was born. Andrew describes it as a single sign-on for a company bank account. When we spoke, he just raised $4 million between his pre-seed and seed rounds. Here are key lessons from Andrew fundraising journey. What your SAFEst bet? As a serial entrepreneur, Andrew knows his way around convertible notes. For this venture, though, he chose to raise through a\\xa0SAFE, or a simple agreement for future equity. He doesn have a hard and fast rule for when to use SAFE or a different approach. But for this company, he was looking for a clean, simple and quick investing strategy. That exactly what a SAFE offers. It effectively a contract to buy equity in a future round.  kinds of terms on a SAFE can come into play, Andrew says.  is basically that the investor wants a discount on the next round. That discount may come by saying that the SAFE will convert at a price no greater than X. Alternately, a SAFE can have a ceiling called a\\xa0cap, which ensures an investor money goes further in the next round. If the cap is placed at $7 million and you raise the following round at $10 million, the investor gets to buy his or her shares as if they had invested at a $7 million valuation. If a SAFE is raised when a company is valued at $10 million, and discount is 20 percent with no cap, investors get to buy in at the $8 million level.  discount and the cap play into each other, Andrew explains.  think that a really important feature for entrepreneurs to understand, because investors understand it very well. It pays to get your story right When Andrew started his pre-seed round, he only had a prototype and a PowerPoint to show investors.  is one of those  do what I do, but do what I say things, he says. The issue wasn so much having an unfinished product as having an unrefined pitch, Andrew explains.  first story we took to the market didn fully capture the vision. He has helped other entrepreneurs tell their stories, but it still took him 14 months to get the story right for Teampay.  the beginning you want to test the story, knowing it going to change, and simplify things, he says.  wins an investment deal are the slides you\\xa0remove\\xa0from the deck, not the slides you put in it. Andrew also realized that the problem Teampay solves  managing employee purchases  might not be relatable for some VCs. But pitching VCs who have very little experience with a certain product is something many entrepreneurs face. That why it critical for founders to learn to communicate their company value proposition crisply and clearly.  were not building a better mousetrap, says Andrew.  were getting rid of mouse traps all together. That really hard for people to understand if they never had a mice problem. They haven had 200 people with multiple layers of delegation, sharing a corporate card attached to a clipboard and writing in what they bought. One of Andrew potential investors was so inexperienced with company purchases that he dismissed Teampay as a solution for poorly run companies. But Andrew was confident he could find a language potential investors could understand. He did so through an analogy:  you familiar with single sign on, you familiar with source code control. Yet none of them exist for a company money. Those turned out to be the magic words for some investors. 4 tips on pitching When it comes to pitch structure, Andrew has strong opinions: 1.\\xa0Keynote\\xa0over PowerPoint.  because it always looks better, he says. 2. Tell a story with slide titles. Avoid building a series of slides with generic titles like: The Problem, The Solution, The Business Model. Instead, use the titles to tell a narrative.  this technique of using the title of the slide to tell the main point, and then using the slide itself to list supporting data points, he says.  creates a really nice structure. By doing it this way, investors are left with the impression of a full narrative built from the titles. Andrew says that you know that you on the right track when you can read the story from the slide previews on the left side of the screen. 3. Have an answer for the question,  now?  important to be part of a trend, says Andrew.  if you doing something different. Why is this important now? What is going on? Then talk about your solution. Then talk about your product. Too many people spend five slides talking about the product. The product is not the business. 4. Be selective on your slide content. Andrew recommends building an\\xa0exhaustive appendix\\xa0to your pitch, instead of trying to cram every detail into the slides.  you create a succinct story around why this is an obvious, inevitable change in the world? Andrew asks.  else is for backup. Giving potential investors a fully-fleshed out appendix lets them ask more thoughtful questions. It ensures that you have all the details you need close at hand, without muddying the story. The only catch is that it might take a few meetings with investors for an entrepreneur to identify which questions to include in the appendix. When can you quit refining your pitch? Andrew says you figure it out.  a founder or an entrepreneur, you need to be constantly iterating your story, and constantly simplifying it. You recognize when you get that  moment.

       "  'A quick and easy way to figure out if your startup is solving the problem that really matters. Just update a Google Sheet.  in love with the problem not the solution, and the rest will follow. That the\\xa0advice from Uri Levine\\xa0just before he sold his startup Waze to Google for $1.1 billion. Is your startup building a solution\\xa0looking\\xa0for problem? How do you know that you solving the right problem? An excellent primer on building a better mental model around solving for the problem and not leading with the solution is the thought-provoking talk by Y Combinator Partner,\\xa0Kevin Hale\\xa0during a very well conceived\\xa026 min presentation. Kevin advice is that the difference between a startup and a typical business is that a startup is built for\\xa0rapid\\xa0growth. Your main objective early on is to figure out what problem you are solving and if its\\xa0worth\\xa0solving. But is the problem big enough for investors to care? Many investors (particularly VCs) don care if your problem isn grand enough to satisfy one or more of the following criteria: 1m+ users: Is your startup impact at least a million people?Growing 20%+/year: in a market that is growing at least 20%/yr and showing that the problem is growing rapidly.Timely: People have this problem have and are actively trying to solve.$1b TAM: The problem is expensive to solve with at least a billion dollar\\xa0Total Addressable Market\\xa0(TAM).Law Changed: The problem now exists based on changes in law or regulation (think the Affordable Care Act and all the healthcare startups it inspired).Hourly: Problem that people have or need to solve multiple times a day (think Slack or Facebook) that keeps users sticky and coming back constantly. So how do you ensure that you are not simply creating a solution in search of a problem? Based on this problem evaluation framework I created a Google Sheet that takes the essence of this advice and lets you enter in a few bits of data about the problem that you are attempting to solve then gives you a score and visualization based on the magnitude of the problem in key areas: Popularity: How many have the problem?Growth: How fast is this problem growing?Urgency: When is this problem relevant?Cost: How expensive is this problem to solve?Mandatory: Is it now necessary to solve (i.e. new law)Frequency: Is this a problem that needs solving very often? You can open the\\xa0Google Sheet here, but just copy it so that you can edit for yourself. Would love any feedback on how this could be improved or if you find it helpful! As most of my writing resolves around the concept of\\xa0crowdsourcing\\xa0and\\xa0data analytics\\xa0I hoping to make this sheet valuable to any startup founder that is looking to fact-check their assumptions.',\n",

So how to reduce risks and avoid common mistakes of project management? In this article, we highlight seven reasons why tech projects fail and give you some actionable tips to avoiding it. The gap between executives and counterparts in the product, engineering, design, and marketing often causes serious consequences. First of all, it often happens that senior management or sponsors don spend much time getting involved with the project. They provide their requirements and wait for teams to produce the desired result. Not being able to ask questions or suggest changes, teams are forced to continue developing  On the other hand, tech experts are rarely sociable enough. The common belief that nobody but the IT department can understand what happening leads to a lack of accountability. If your tech lead can convey the project details to the non-tech executives, your project totally depends on a group of people within one department, which is a huge mistake. In the early stages of project development, everybody has own view on how everything should be done. In a perfect world, the opinion of all counterparts should be heard and taken into account. However, in the real world, 39% of projects fail because of bad requirements. It means that business stakeholders often move forward with their requirements without getting input from employees responsible for the product. Source It has something in common with the previous parts. This time the problem concerns your relationships with customers. Requirements are often defined by an intermediary who fails to consult or involve people who will eventually use the product. Not knowing your real customers needs will definitely result in a failure. So, before starting a project you need to answer one simple question:  anyone need what we are going to build? Although it impossible to predict how much time the project will take, there are lots of serious issues that can be avoided only by taking the estimating process more seriously. As people who actually perform the work often are rarely allowed to take part in the estimating process, the estimates often appear to be too far from reality. Moreover, to make the project seem more attractive, estimates may be arbitrarily cut, which leads to setting unreasonable deadlines. Hurrying up to finish the project, the team may overlook or deliberately skip some crucial aspects. Source Diving into the performance without thinking is another reason for project failure. The problem is often caused by underestimating the project complexity (see Reason 4). Here are the most common planning issues: Not discussing clear roles and responsibilities.Teams follow their own schedule not first getting corresponding commitments from other members who also have to commit to the schedule.Not adding a risk or contingency buffer to the project timeline.Not breaking a large scale action plan into separate more manageable pieces. Not tracking your project, you can address occurring issues in the early stages. Such delays later result in other knock-on problems. Being ready to update the schedule is crucial. With sufficient monitoring, you can notice that the project is running into difficulties and fix it without serious consequences. However, missing this moment, you have to spend much more money and efforts redoing the work done. Source Critical decisions are often made by people having little practical experience in the area. On the other hand, teams working on the project avoid making decisions no to be responsible for future consequences. Moreover, not tracking the project (see Reason 6), stakeholders aren aware of the unscheduled issues and fail to make the right decisions. Source Even the best ideas fail to be successful when poorly translated into actions. I circled out 10 crucial project management tips that will help you prevent project failure: 1. Learn what your audience needs: ask your sales team for feedback, read reviews for similar projects, talk to people that are likely to use your product or service directly. 2. Take time to conduct additional market research and analyze other niche players experience. 3. Involve people who will actually perform the work to the estimating process.  4. Don make firm estimates but encapsulate the unknowns. 5. Establish effective communications between groups involved in the project. 6. Engage technical lead to provide clear and concise reports.Consider the opinion of all counterparts at the early stages of project planning. 7. Encourage executives to be involved in the project. 8. Plan beforehand: set clear roles, make sure different teams plans correspond, add a risk contingency, etc. 9. Always keep monitoring and analyzing intermediate results. 10. Be ready to respond to changes. Regardless all the recommendations you can find on the Internet, hiring tech people being a non-tech person is a challenge (and I doubt whether you should accept it). If you have little experience in project management and your internal specialists are already over capacity, you can always hire remote workers. Such companies as CodeControl or Honeypot can help you hire talented freelance developers or even get assembled project team within several days.',\n",
       "  \"How to know which feedback to listen to for your\\xa0startup. If you starting a new business, launching a new idea, or doing anything at all really, you going to be getting a lot of feedback. People are going to tell you if they love it. And you inevitably going to hear some verison of:  not a good idea. The fact is, you probably going to hear that one a lot, and from a lot of different people. Some of them perfectly well-meaning. So, how do we determine which feedback matters the most? When we overwhelmed with messages about our ideas being too risky or not good enough, how do we filter out the noise and get to the feedback that really matters?\\xa0 How do we know whether to listen to the people saying yes, or the people saying no? I dealt with this problem a lot. Over the course of my entrepreneurial journey, I had more than a few ideas.\\xa0 Some of them were winners.\\xa0 Many, not so much. Some I never really got the chance to find out if they would be successful until it was too late.\\xa0 Some I left behind because I listened to the wrong feedback.\\xa0 This is the story of an idea that I wish I done more with, and how it taught me which feedback to listen to, and which to ignore. Looking back at this, I realize what I should have done differently (and that I potentially could have made a lot of money!) had I only known then what I telling you now. One weekend, my buddy Krish managed to get us a spot in a lean startup machine workshop. Normally, this would have cost us a few thousand dollars. Somehow though, he managed to get us in for free. For three days, we be attending this workshop and working on our own ideas for a startup. I was pretty excited for this opportunity. I'd recently read The Lean Startup, and was interested in getting more hands on with it. Inside the workshop, we divided up into groups of three to five people. Each group was tasked with coming up with a potential startup idea. Once we had one, it was time to hit the streets. Having the idea wasn enough. We needed proof that our idea had value, and we needed to get that by getting people to sign onto it in one form or another. We needed to hear from our potential customers. Now, a lot of the people in my group lived in the upper east side. This workshop? It was in downtown Manhattan. This was before the days of Uber. We had two options for getting there. Either we cough up the money for a very expensive cab ride, or we use the subway for a much cheaper, but also much slower, commute. This was the problem that we tackled with our startup idea. We called our solution  A very clever twist on the phrase  People would use an app to find others going to the same place as them and share a cab, splitting the cost. If you drawing parallels between what we were thinking about and rideshare apps? Trust me, I been doing that for a while, too. When it came time to test our idea, we planted ourselves in front of a Whole Foods market. The plan was simple. We wait to see someone hailing a cab and ask them if they be interested in a program like ours. We even had a little application. When someone said they were interested, we ask them where they were going so we could find a match for them.\\xa0 Sort of. For the purposes of this test, I was the person waiting for the ride, and trust me, I just so happened to be going the same direction. They be matched up with me, I hop in the cab, and off we go. We made small talk along the way, and then, at the end of the ride, we split the cost. The people I talked to seemed to genuinely enjoy this idea. Not surprising, right? Who doesn want cheaper transportation? Whether that was the idea itself or just my winning personality, you be the judge. As we did this, we got people to give us money. So, when it came time for the judges to determine which group had the best idea? We were pretty sure that we were going to win. We did not, in fact, win. The judges told us that, despite the fact that we made some money, our plan wasn a good idea. It simply wasn going to work. The winner of the competition had proposed an app that would let people know when a parking spot opened up and where it was. I sure it a complete surprise that a lot of people in NYC were thinking about traffic, commuting, and parking. Their group hadn gotten anyone to give them money, like ours had. Instead, they had gotten people to sign a letter of intent to use the app. The judges decided this was the better approach. Now, I don want to harp on their idea, but I do feel like it is worth pointing out that a parking spot in NYC is probably only open for about 60 seconds on a good day  according to the team whom presented their findings... By the time you check an app, find an open spot, and drive to it? That spot isn empty anymore.\\xa0 That probably the reason we not seeing this kind of app around much. Nevertheless, we took the advice of the judges.\\xa0 After all, they were experts on these things, right?\\xa0 This had only been a weekend idea for us, not a serious venture. And the judges had told us it hadn been good enough. Why continue on with it? Obviously, given the success of rideshare apps, we probably should have ignored them. The judges, the experts on the issue? They were the feedback we chose to listen to. They weren the feedback we should have been listening to, though. The customers that we had over the course of the trial had been giving us feedback too. They been doing it with their wallets, and they been doing it in a positive way.\\xa0 That was the feedback we should have been listening to. Our customers voted with their wallets, and we decided to listen to the people who had no financial interest in the matter. When you launch a new idea, that idea is always going to have some detractors. Those detractors might even be the experts. They might tell you that your idea isn a good one. That there isn a market for what you thinking of doing. That data? It really isn all that useful. The useful data comes from your customers, and how they choose to vote with their wallets. We had people voting yes, putting their dollars down on our idea. We didn listen to them. We listened to the experts instead. That was our mistake. Don let it be yours. When you starting something new, the main feedback you need to listen to is the one that comes from the customers. Are they willing to spend money on what you proposing? That answer matters more than any other, and is going to really tell you if your idea can work or not. When people vote with their wallets, listen to them.

       "  \"Machine learning is the best method of data analysis. It also automates the creation of analytical business models. This is the reason why machine learning plays an important role in the growth of a business. Hence, your business will probably need new and highly inspired ideas to deploy machine learning solutions into your business. However, the implementation of machine learning can bring several challenges.\\xa0 To identify the deployment challenges of machine learning applications, businesses require to have a complete understanding of the current ML technologies and the current advancements.  To identify the model deployment challenges in the implementation of ML applications, businesses require industry experts with a deep understanding of the current AI / ML technologies. Or, hire machine learning developers to deal with the issue of lack of compatibility between the machine learning model and business workflow that impacts the deployment of ML applications.\\xa0 Machine learning models are commonly built using languages such as Java, C, Python, R, and SQL. For example, there have been lots of advances in the Facebook ability to detect faces or Amazon Alexa ability to recognize specific voice command. Specifically, business firms must ensure that they should get answers to such questions: For the successful deployment of machine learning, businesses need to have a proper understanding of the data flows, algorithms, and how they can be applied to different processes. For companies with machinery & equipment, machine learning provides a platform to predict proactive measures and possible failures in the production department. The specific algorithm needs to be observed to characterize the normal operation state.\\xa0\\xa0 The ethical challenges in machine learning involve the issues related to how the data is used. There have been certain instances of racial biases in the machine learning programs that are also affecting the implementation of ML technology unintentionally.\\xa0 Here is the example: Similarly, while talking to a customer care representative it is becoming hard for people to understand whether they are talking to a human or a machine. This simply makes the ML solution a tough technology to implement. A famous case of racism happened two years ago in which the mislabelling of two African-American young guys by Google facial recognition software, which had classified the two teenagers as Gorillas.  Developers need to make more transparent ML decisions with respect to ethics and user behavior. Your technical team needs to collect enough of the data with regards to ethical measures to appropriately train ML applications. It is important because different situations require different ethical approaches and system should be designed according to their goals and behaviors so that ML development technologies should benefit and empower as many people as possible.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Data acquisition and storage is a real challenge in the ML implementation. Just look at the example, a healthcare project was aimed to cut their costs for the treatment of patients with pneumonia. So, they have implemented machine learning to sort out the patient records to see who at high risk of infection and should be there in the hospital, and who is at the low infection risk from pneumonia.\\xa0 Still, they can make sense of the data records, hence, the machine learning will be of no use or perhaps even useless for them. So, what the right way to handle such challenges?\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 For instance, in Travel tech data fragmentation is one of the main issues. Wherein hotel knows the guests' credit card details, home addresses, contact number, and other details. This data get transferred to different departments within the hotel. So, it not always possible for the hotel team to converge all data streams. Well, that can be harmful to the guests. A large amount of data and missing values in data can reduce prediction accuracy and that wrong-headed. Thanks to machine learning, the approximated & predicted values it provides are considered as  correct for a software algorithm. The points described here are basic and straightforward. However, you still need machine learning expert if you need to solve the method of data acquisition & storage mechanisms, set the complete infrastructure, and look for complex machine learning tasks. Smart businesses understand the possibility to rely on data-driven decisions in their business activities. And, lots of data mean lots of storage. So, how can this stuff turn useful and how much does it cost? In many cases, the cost analysis of the options is required to make an informed decision.\\xa0 Let see the steps involved in developing a custom machine learning model and how the cost may vary for each step.\\xa0 Requirements: The requirement phase is all about understanding what your business needs from the model. We recommend you to have clear ideas on what you want for your business because a too vague idea will make the cost explode.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Data: You can consider data as the experience for your business model. If you train the business model with a lot of good quality experience, it will learn better how to solve our purpose. The cost for this process can be zero if your data is model ready, otherwise, it should take some investment. And, if we talk about big datasets to be managed with a cluster the cost can go on the thousands. Model: It always important to evaluate your business model to benchmark the cost effectively. It also takes several days to evaluate & choose the algorithm, train the business model, test it, and implement. This is the core part of your business process and it really not easy to decide on its cost.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Production: Once your algorithm is tested and is ready for production, there are two main activities to manage: Both are not mandatory for your business, so also here the cost may go from zero to some thousand dollars.\\xa0 So, the ML algorithm and deep learning development work are the main factors to look for. It true that performance rate depends on the client business objective and the cost of data predictions. Machine learning projects need time to achieve better results. Even if you are lucky and your ML algorithm matches up with the benchmarks immediately, chances are your program will work efficiently or will get completely failed.\\xa0 Hence, continuous monitoring can only protect your ML model from degradation, but things will improve with time. Also defining your business metrics, planning technical architecture at the earliest stage decides the success or failure of your ML venture.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Hopefully, it was a really deep dive for you into the world of ML implementation for business startups. The key lies in minimizing the challenges and creating more benefits through the adoption of ML development that give your business the core capabilities of machine learning. \\xa0 \\xa0  \",\n",
       "  \"When I first started applying to MBA programs a few people suggested I look into Executive MBAs as well, which I thought had a negative connotation to it. A bunch of C-suite execs in suits, which turned out to be completely wrong. Lets backtrack a little I been in startups/tech for over a decade now when I started my first company in college (Brandyourself.com), did PR for a little and then a few other digital media related companies before my latest role in venture capital for the last few years. I love my job as it allows me to meet amazing people almost every day, along with learning a tremendous amount that spans almost every industry, which I can then apply to our investments and new founders and investors that I meet. A nice continuous loop. Well as some of you know, regardless of how the media portrays it, there is no such thing as an overnight success and things either don work out for most companies or it just takes a really long time. After three years, I made some great investments that have grown, some that just getting by and painfully some that didn work out. It very much a rollercoaster of emotions sometimes knowing that it a hit business and most of your investments won work out, hoping for a few big ones if you lucky  yes there is a lot of luck in investing too. So in order to keep growing, learning and increase my ability to help, I decided that I need a more structured program and environment for that  MBA! I only applied to schools (UCLA, USC, NYU, Columbia and Cornell) in LA and NYC, two cities that I love, have big tech scenes and where my network is. I applied, got recommendations from some of my friends, advisors, and mentors, waited and finally started to hear back a few months later rejected, rejected, rejected, waitlisted, waitlisted (same order as schools above). Rejections are never fun but being waitlisted isn a no! Have to stay positive. This was around early November when I found out I was waitlisted and just kept following up to see if anything changed. By mid-December Columbia told me that most people accepted full-time offers and that they wouldn be considering the waitlist this year  that wasn a fun call. They recommended that I apply for their\\xa0EMBA-Americas\\xa0program, so I said sure, they sent over my application to that team and I was accepted two days later. It was a long two days, so when I got the email and call, I was kind of in shock I really didn know what I had been accepted into but they wanted me. So what is the program? It actually very unique in that I still working full-time but take classes for one week a month. It generally the first week of every month starting Tuesdays around 830am until 645pm through Saturday, all day  not just nights and weekends but five intense days of lectures, homework and tests. In 20 months, I have a full MBA. I think most people still have nightmares about homework and tests that are now becoming real again, so a lot of people have asked me why I decided to get an MBA: * Keep learning  I have learned so much over the last decade that I still trying to figure out how to apply. Sometimes you need to go back to basics and strengthen other things that you think you know. Our first eight months are the core classes, so I torturing myself with statistics, accounting and corporate finance again while brushing up on leadership, strategy, and economics. Having a structured environment to learn in again, especially from very smart professors has been a refreshing experience. I looking forward to choosing electives once the core is over. *Connections, network and alumni  A lot of the advice I received when considering to pursue an MBA was that I should definitely focus on my school work but also make sure to network and meet everyone. Fortunately I do that now in my current role, so hopefully I good at it and can continue to expand my network. *Still working full-time  This was an interesting benefit from the program that you required to still work, even though we have school one week a month. In the tech world, I couldn imagine taking two years off as I would fall behind. It also forces me to better structure my time and allows me to directly apply what I learning as well. I totally understand and was convinced the full-time two year was better for me but I very pleased with this structure. *We have to travel  Every semester (4 months) we will spend a week in a different city. This year we will travel to Seattle, Toronto, Israel and Chile as a class to take classes and meet with local companies/professioanls. *Name and ego  Yes it an Ivy and my mom is very proud of me but I also very proud of myself. There is no shame in admitting it does feel good to say and I really am honored to be apart of it. I went to Syracuse undergrad and had an amazing experience but it generally known as a former party school and their basketball. We now completed 7 weeks (7 months) of the program and I learned a lot already  pretty much a crash course back into school. But none of this would be possible without the amazing group of other professionals (44) in my class who mostly are based outside of New York and fly in every month for the program. Without their support, enthusiasm, kvetching and kvelling, I don't know how I could have survived myself. And within the class, we split into learning teams of six that work together specifically on certain assignments and presentations. Shout out to Seal Team 6, two of whom are in NYC, with one from Minnesota, Mexico City and Brazil. I definitely can do this without you. So in the end, I couldn be happier with the program I was accepted into and now have so much more respect for anyone in an executive program. I also would highly recommend it if you can make it work as well. The average age of my class is 33 (ranges from 26 from over 20 states and countries around the world, across almost all industries  doctors, designers, accountants, bankers and family businesses. Only three people are in tech/startups/VC which is kind of refreshing. It was a rough few months studying/taking the GREs, applying and getting rejected, only to end up in a program that I think is the best fit for me. I looking forward to spending a lot of time with my classmates over the next year and learning as much as I can from them all. I also have to give a shout out to all my friends that gave me a recommendation for my application and amazing advice as well: David Rose, Jenny Friendman, Alex Goldberg, Jeremy Kagan, Gil Fuchsberg, Alex Yagoda, Joseph DiTomaso, Meghan Cross, Todd Breden, Pamela Minetti, Owen Davis, and Bronson Lingamfelter.\",\n",

I started my career in early 2000, attendees faxed us their registrations, and we put them in an Excel spreadsheet, Allie says.  wanted to find ways of automating our processes so that we could take use of our most valuable resource, our people. Allie company, Hubb, keeps track of everything you need when you running an event. The platform collects and manages event data. It also enables marketing and facilitates attendee experiences by building calendars and schedules. Allie started Hubb by bootstrapping, like she had for her previous two companies. Eventually, she decided the time was right to scale up. She was able to go into her first round of fundraising with some proof of product. She could point to giants like Microsoft and Intel as satisfied customers.  we went to market in 2015, I self funded the company, Allie says.  small team, very small marketing budget. But we ended the year with 21 paying customers and about $650,000 in revenue. We knew there was a market, and that it could be very successful. Eventually, Allie knew the market was ripe for scaling up. But she points out that it a situational thing. With Hubb, she watched the market to make sure the time was right. She decided to pull the trigger when she realized that additional capital would allow her business to grow at a much faster rate, and that Hubb would still be the first SaaS platform in the market.  said,  I can continue to bootstrap, or\\xa0 what is the market saying right now?

I didn know what a cap table was. I didn really know what venture capital was. But I knew that I had an idea I could take to market if I had some funding. Allie decided the Seattle Angel Conference would help her form the relationships she needed to get the ball rolling. She emailed the conference the day before applications were due to let them know to expect an application from Hubb.

If you make it to the next round, lots of people ask you questions: talk about your model, how you scale. Allie took her pitch through four or five rounds of meetings during the conference. Each pitch helped refine her story. Through this process, she was introduced to the Oregon Angel Fund, now Oregon Venture Funds, and Elevate Capital. Allie was careful about who she selected to lead her Series A, knowing she would need someone to help her understand the intricacies of fundraising for her first round.

The investor community in the Pacific Northwest is tightly knit, and Allie says that had some very specific benefits.  you go through diligence with one group, they share it with another group. When investors share diligence information, a founder has that much more time to focus on their business instead of the pitching process. Allie points out that another way to maintain that focus is by working with groups of investors, instead of individuals, as much as possible.  an entrepreneur, pitching is just one more thing you have to do, she says.  still have to be running your company, hitting all your metrics and growing. I think about it as time invested. Allie suggests that if it an option, focus on funds instead of individual angels.  you get 10 angels, they may write checks for $25,000 apiece, she says.  then you dealing with 10 different people with 10 different sets of questions, views and perspectives. But at a fund? All of the investors contribute, and entrepreneurs only deal with a single point of contact.

But for all founders, no matter how long they been at it, she has one word to sum up her advice: grit.  was turned down just as many times as anyone else, Allie says.  was told that my business didn make sense and my model wouldn work. I could have easily said,  you right.

       "  '(a+b) = a + b + 2ab . Remember this age old math formula? What happens if I add another variable/dimension to this equation? The results change, the unfolded rule is no more valid. Rules and laws have to change and mend on introduction of new variables. On adding a dimension, the dynamics changes. Well technology, especially the internet based technology is that dimension for the rules/laws of our society, economy and human life, in general. Let dig deeper by exploring different scenarios, one by one: For several years, governments and rulers across the world have kept a close eye on the ways people can organise themselves, as such organisations are the starting point to voice opinions, concerns, question the authority, start rebellions, changes and revolts. In emergency or high control situations people are forbidden to collect at one place in order to curb the unwanted activites and rebellions. However, with the advent of social medias and instant messaging apps this dynamics has changed a lot. People used to get influenced by the conversations they had with fellow human beings restricted to the niches but now we see these as\\xa0highly polarised group of humans all across the world wide web.  With this wider scope, the information providing platforms have gotten all the power to manipulate people and are mediums through which government can keep even closer eyes on the citizens. Would we ever know if the tech giants and governments are in agreement already? If such a pact happens it a win-win for both the goverment and tech companies. For access to all this information, makes a government super powerful, and in that case it will become really difficult to uproot the ruling government.\\xa0This will shatter down the core essence of democracy.\\xa0On the other hand, for the tech companies, this is a big win too, as they be able to operate in that geography in harmony with the government and keep on luring customers, collect their data and sell them ads. Who holds the compass of ethics and where does it lie? What if the Orwellian vision has gotten real? Along with the\\xa0formation of groups or organisations, internet based applications have essentially changed the way humans interact. We interact with Uber drivers, if it the shared cab we are frequently surrounded by a group of strangers, we get our food from delivery persons, we collect our parcels from delivery persons,\\xa0the points of contact with fellow humans\\xa0have increased multifold. Think about the possible ways such a predefined network of interactions be exploited. Parallely, let take a hypothetical scenario that a region get struck with an epidemic, what are the laws today to govern these points of contact. Can government suspend the functioning of these services all together? Is Government, as of today, capable of doing that? How will the economic loss be accounted for in such a situation? Let shift our focus to something very common,  As financial transactions were considered very important, an authentic channel was built to conduct these. Currency coins, notes, cheques, banks, gold and government, everything in place to ensure the credibility of this system.\\xa0But as technology grew, we started focussing more on user convenience.\\xa0Now there are numerous apps ranging from Google Pay, Phone Pe, PayTm, BHIM UPI etc, that help in conducting the transaction in few clicks. I not claiming they are insecure, they might be based on a really secure algorithm, my concern is the number of ways to make payments have increased and math would support the notion that, subsequently, number of ways to break them have also increased. Just increased outlets for conducting a financial transaction which poses a security challenge is not the only concern here, we have different online currencies now, OlaMoney, Paytm credit, Airtel Money, Amazon Money and so on. Our banks comply with stringent policies, how strict are the policies w.r.t these online wallets? What is there combined effect on economy? How will these behave in the time of economic instability? These are yet centralised, with the boom of blockchain based currencies, the centrality and government control of the currency in itself is a question that would need addressal. Should authenticating financial transactions be convenient, governed or distributed? Apart from being affected at a mob level, technology has deeply affected our own little personal spheres. Individualism has been shot up by platforms that offer each one of us our own little celebrity world. A place where we can project ourselves as we want others to see us, where we can post about our life and people  it. What is it doing with our psyche? We are affected by the false notions of fame and validations. There was a friend of mine, who once uploaded a profile pic. I told him verbally that it a great pic but yet he asked me,  you didn  it? The act of pressing that button has become more desirable and assuring than a fellow human giving the compliment in person. What kind of world have we developed? People prefer chats over in person communication. There are cases of youngsters unable to maintain a simple eye contact and getting awkward approaching people in real life. People spend hours waiting for likes, posting, sharing memes and looking at meaningless posts. Imbalanced exposure to loads of irrelevant and crap posts on social medias are numbing our sense to question  at the time when the\\xa0spread of misinformation\\xa0has already started. Human beings have always been vulnerable, especially in several psychological ways, the sad part is technology exploiting it on a daily basis,\\xa0getting us hooked. Our attention span has reduced , we are exposed to unregulated amounts of  notifications that our biological selves are incapable of processing at once. We have grown used to  of it all and have become impatient. The youth is mistaken into building amazing online presence and equally shallow personal selves. Technology has deeply affected how we perceive ourselves and people around us, we trust digital signals more than people we know, which is an undesirable situation. As much as I would have loved to say this is a mere worry, we all know it is not. It might not be you but look around, you spot every other person having an unhealthy digital intervention in their lives. Our senses are lured into consuming the things businesses have produced for us to buy. We need to be curious more than ever, as there is no  upon and discovering things on internet anymore. Our feeds, and information is filtered according to our interests, we are shown only what we already believe in, which is not at all conflicting. Truth be told, reality is full of conflicts, but our digital lives are far away from any of it, offering us a cake walk, free of conflicts, worries, raw truths , offering instant gratification at every swipe. The ability to see the truth has been hampered, the bad news is the curiosity to know it and face it in reality is also being killed. We don want to believe that we have been tricked or manipulated, or we are too susceptible to our false egos and vanity, seeking validation in form of likes or followers. Please remember,  as a human are enough. That was my thought train this post tried to capture, there is so much more that needs discussion and there is so much more we need to realize about technological impacts, but let put an end to this post here. I be back soon with yet another post covering more insights about the impact of this added dimension in different spheres of our lives, till then take care, be human and keep your curiosity levels high, it time to question the  ',\n",
       "  \"Singapore is home to some of the best schools in the field of Computer Science, specifically\\xa0Artificial Intelligence. The\\xa0cutting edge research going on there is unparalleled. Colleges like Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and\\xa0National University of Singapore (NUS)\\xa0have a great reputation all over the world for their CS programs.\\xa0 An opportunity presented itself to me when I was in my college in SRMIST, Chennai, India. A Global Academic Internship Programme (GAIP) by Corporate Gurukul, which sends students interested/experienced in\\xa0Artificial Neural Networks and Big Data to NUS to study under world class faculty. I wasn't letting this pass, so I signed up for it, cleared the interview and got in!\\xa0 It was December 2018 and I was on my flight to Singapore ð\\x9f\\x87¸ð\\x9f\\x87¬. The\\xa0Academic Internship was very exciting because of it's thorough\\xa0syllabus covering the basics and advanced topics related to Artificial Neural Networks(ANN) and Big Data (more on these topics later).\\xa0In a span of 15 days we had to work on two projects trying to implement whatever that was taught in the lectures keeping in mind the business value of the project that was being developed.\\xa0 We covered ANN for the first 8 days, followed by Big Data in the remaining. ANN Lectures were delivered by\\xa0Dr. Lek Hsiang Hui,\\xa0Dr. Tan Wee Kek and\\xa0Dr. Wang Wei.\\xa0 Firstly, we had\\xa0Dr. Lek Hsiang Hui who gave us an introduction to Data Analytics. It was a really good insight and added value to my understanding of the same concept.\\xa0 Secondly, we had\\xa0Dr. Tan Wee Kek who presented the concepts of Machine Learning in a very intuitive manner, and I was able to grasp most of the concepts with ease. Things I understood and implemented: An artificial neural network is designed to function like the neurons in the brain. Lastly,\\xa0Dr. Wang Wei introduced us to topics revolving around Artificial Neural Networks. These topics were harder to understand with the level of Calculus involved but Dr. Wei did a great job at teaching us the basics. Here's everything that I learned and implemented: We had to present our Artificial Neural Networks Course Project two days after our final lecture. Those days went by really quickly with little or no sleep as me and my group mates hustled to finish our project called Quick Draw. We wanted to make something that has great scope for real-world implementation and helps the society.\\xa0Our program tracks the strokes of the user and gives an output predicting what the user is trying to draw in real-time. Quick Draw uses the existing Google's Dataset\\xa0of various labeled hand drawn images in the Numpy Array format. We downloaded the data of 4 classes (20,000 images each) and started training it with different algorithms. First we started off with SVM, then K-Means Clustering, then Feed-Forward Neural Network, then Convolutional Neural Network and finally Long Short-term Memory (LSTM).\\xa0We found out that CNN and LSTM gave us the highest accuracies. So we decided to use those two models and we made a front end for our project using OpenCV library which is basically taking input of our strokes from the keyboard. You can checkout the project\\xa0here. Now moving on to the\\xa0Big Data Course, the second one of our internship. This course was delivered by\\xa0Ravindra Kumar, or as we call him,\\xa0God of Linux. He helped us work on some really complicated linux commands, broke them down for us so that we find it easy. Here are the topics that I learned and implemented: After the lectures, we had to work on a\\xa0project\\xa0in which we set up a\\xa0three node cluster\\xa0deployed on a platform and managed using\\xa0Ambari. We had to do everything from scratch, set up\\xa0password-less SSH\\xa0between the three nodes, setup\\xa0Java, JDBC, Hadoop environments on the .bashrc file, creating a local repository, transferring data from the local repository to\\xa0HBASE\\xa0and then performing operations on that Data. We chose the book called 'Sherlock' from the Gutenberg Library and\\xa0performed Word-Count and MapReduce programs on it. Every step of the project was done mostly through shell commands which was really cool and helped us understand the working of Linux commands, when and where to use them.\\xa0 It was a\\xa0really enriching experience\\xa0to learn from the best in the world and work on projects under their guidance. I also would like to\\xa0thank the Teaching Assistants(TA) for the course Puru Sharma and\\xa0Devvrit Khattri, they were always there to help us out with any difficulty that we would face and help us overcome it. Thank you for reading!\",\n",
       "  \"Roughly three and a half years ago, we started working on Tara AI, however the genesis of the story begins much earlier. It all began when I had the good fortune of meeting Syed Ahmed in freshman year of college, our company current co-founder and CTO. Everyday, I continue to meet with founders and hopeful entrepreneurs that are starting companies with enormous potential, and I find that the first hurdle they have to cross, is finding a partner-in-crime. I truly believe that going about building a company is an arduous journey, and its nearly impossible to build a lasting high-growth company without a co-founder (kudos to those who have achieved this as single founders). I also come to realize, that if you can convince another human being to invest all of their time and energy in building this  that doesn currently exist, then other obstacles start to become easier (even if it by a factor of 0.0001%). It was the year 2006, Facebook had just started rolling out to universities and you needed an invite with a .edu email address to get  Nokia flip-phones were a thing. So was watching movies on your iPod Nano. I was 16 and in freshman year (Finance), and I happened to meet Syed (Mechanical Engineering) through a student extracurriculars club. Over the next few years, we engaged in long discussions about the process of selecting a major and the usefulness of a 4 year degree, along with whether or not we were going to remain in the Middle East.\\xa0 Eventually, in 2011, I had to cross the hurdle of asking him to join me on an adventure of starting our first company. Now, looking back, I am attempting to build a framework around the process of finding the right co-founder. One thing I continue to observe is the rise of founder networking events, and apps that promise  dating I find that some of the best places to look for a partner in crime continue to be in your own existing networks. Going through YCombinator with Tara AI, we found friends and companies that have followed a similar framework. Platzi founders, Christian Van Der Henst and Freddy Vega were competitors when they first decided to join forces. The Equipment share co-founders were part of a faith-based commune in Missouri. There are several examples of companies I continue to observe that have long-lasting meaningful co-founder relationships, and they met years (and years) before starting their companies.\\xa0 Asking people you know if they are willing to jump ship or drop off their career trajectory, to build something that doesn exist, is easier said than done. However, some of the most risk-averse people may end up surprising you by saying yes to embarking on the co-founder journey. The key, is to de-risk the value proposition of your business and set a milestone that can be achieved in a short amount of time. This may include finding a set of target customers, building an MVP or making your first sale. In my case, after graduation, Syed and I went our separate ways. Syed started a career in big data and mechanical engineering with a postgrad from QUT, and I was in finance and data analysis. He was insistent that I find a set of target customers (and close them) before he would agree to work on Tara AI full-time.\\xa0  built on Facebook's open graph will not last  amazes me how enterprise infrastructure continues to be filled with security vulnerabilities.  much of software development is a repeatable process and majority of functioning code in applications can be attributed to open-source. These were a few of Syed predictions/observations in 2006, before they became obvious to the technology industry. I now made it a rule in life to seek out individuals that spot anomalies or early patterns invisible to others, as colleagues, investors or co-workers. I admit, early on, I was dismissive to several of Syed observations. However, over time, by meeting successful founders I learned that those that predict the future, often end up building it. During undergrad (and immediately after) Syed and I were both struggling to make ends meet in our respective fields. I graduated summa cum laude, and Syed had two postgrad degrees, yet we were both struggling to find jobs that paid livable salaries in 2010 (it was right after the financial crisis and companies were rarely hiring for entry-level roles). Somehow, we found ways to earn on the side. Syed started learning programming and he discovered that with $200 we could test our ideas with customers through simple landing pages. Seeing that every fresh graduate was having issues finding jobs, we decided to launch a quick solution and called it Gradberry. In a few days of launching a landing page, we had 2,000 students from 40 universities signed up on a waitlist to find entry-level jobs. We did a lot more with a lot less. Companies are not built overnight; it is a long and arduous journey through customer development to get to product-market fit. Most companies fail because founders give up. The emotional journey can take an immense toll, which is why I believe conviction is an extremely under-appreciated personality trait.\\xa0 To continue to have faith in your idea (and pivot as necessary) takes an almost  level of effort. It continues to baffle me how individuals with conviction in their beliefs, can move mountains. As a founder, you need to focus on being relentless and continue to prove your market hypotheses. I remember our Y Combinator interview only rolled around after we had unsuccessfully applied twice. After the interview, I was convinced we didn get in. We had applied late (several weeks after the deadline) and so our odds were a miniscule 0.5%. Syed, on the other hand, was convinced we were the right founders to tackle the problem, and that our acceptance call was a few hours away. His intuition proved correct, and the rest is history. Of course, getting into YCombinator was only the first hurdle, and we continued to face adversity as we set out on the journey. However, relying on a core set of beliefs and having a deep conviction about our theses, enabled us to keep chugging along.\\xa0 My thesis: if your potential co-founder displays at least three of the above four traits - 1) there is an existing cordial relationship built on trust, 2) they can spot trends invisible to others, 3) they hustle hard and 4) have conviction in their beliefs, take the leap. Propose and ask if they will quit their day job, quit a degree program or even move to another continent to start the next world-changing company.\\xa0 The worst they can do is say no! P.S. Since founding our current company, Syed and I took another giant leap of faith and are now married. He continues to challenge me everyday. Thank you to David Keith and Nikhil Gopalani for reading through drafts of this (and to Syed Ahmed for adding accuracy to my memory). \",\n",
       "  'In the fast-paced world of software development, there is a fine line between  it fast, and  it right. Deadlines and time-to-market often dictate a pace that can lead engineering teams to implement features or code fixes in the easiest way possible. The benefit of this is that a product can release fast and entice users to their functionality before a competitor has the chance to usurp said prospective users. The downside, however, is a lurking foe that software teams often ignore to at their own peril:\\xa0technical debt. For those unaware, technical debt is a software development concept that implies a future cost of additional work caused by choosing easy solutions to a piece of functionality or project in the short term. In other words, it the result of quick and simple solutions over perfect code. There is one very important thing to keep in mind: creeping technical debt is unavoidable. In at least one point in your codebase future, the decisions of the past will come back to haunt you in some fashion. Technical debt is not always incurred from bad decisions, though. Sometimes it is the result of aging systems or outdated practices implemented before they became outdated. Thankfully, there are concrete strategies and tactics that can be employed early and often to help minimize technical debt when it does eventually rise up from the ashes of decisions-past like a phoenix of bad code design. Let go over a handful of steps you can take to assure that technical debt will be kept at the bare minimum. By no means is this a comprehensive list of ways to avoid technical debt, but these next strategies should be kept in mind before going into your next application planning phase. First, spend a sizable amount of time making sure that any pull requests undergo a fairly rigorous\\xa0code review. This keeps your focus on consistency and quality when it comes to code additions, and allows as many eyes as possible to review the new code, making sure that it meets a standard for ensuring minimal future technical debt. The more eyes that see a piece of code before it is merged into your application, the better. It is far too easy to miss small problems that may come back to haunt you later when you are the only set of eyes that scans your code. Secondly, employ\\xa0continuous integration\\xa0to automate testing on code additions. This prevents faulty code from being merged into your codebase and gives you a means of protection against smaller code-breaking issues arising in the future. Continuous integration also acts as a sort of  code review, as your test cases can scan for issues that arise on a regular basis during code pushes. You can view this as a sort of insurance policy on easy-to-catch bugs making it into your application, and it will absolutely cut down on the bug fixing later. Finally, deploy to a\\xa0testing environment. It is often impossible to catch all issues in the debugging process, so by using a test environment, you can see how your changes will reflect on the codebase before it is ever live for the user, making sure that you will catch any unforeseen problems before they would wreak havoc on your live services. Testing environments are not negotiable in the modern age of SaaS integrations and should be heavily used as a means to make sure your application is running smoothly before deploying to production. Fighting Above Your Weight Class When it comes to planning for the avoidance of future technical debt, prioritizing your strategies should be approached in a top-down strategy. Technical debt at the systemic level will cause the most problems, as it will generally be on an architectural level and therefore most capable of harm. If you cut corners when it comes to application design or planning, you will absolutely pay a heavy price later. Global technical debt should be treated as the next most harmful since it can leak out across several sections of an application if not caught. In this case, microservices that become a distributed monolith tend to be a common cause of major technical debt when it comes to the global scale. Local technical debt is the least harmful and probably the most common, and it should be addressed through refactoring every once in a while. Generally, this is the technical debt that you should not worry too much about catalyzing. It tends to stay localized within its function or method and doesn have a scope large enough to really slow down your application. (Take that statement with a\\xa0HUGE\\xa0grain of salt Float like a Butterfly, Unify like an API There are other ways to fight technical debt besides\\xa0Agile Methodology tactics and strategies, and if applicable for your application use case, they should absolutely be employed. An immensely helpful tool for minimizing technical debt when integrating with cloud services is the use of a\\xa0unified API. A unified API is essentially an abstraction layer that can be used to access as many cloud services as they offer through a set of unified categorical endpoints. As a result, every cloud service provider that falls under a certain category (storage,\\xa0calendar,\\xa0CRM,\\xa0etc.) can be accessed through a single set of endpoints, eliminating the need for separate CRUD endpoints for each cloud service. Another major benefit of unified APIs is the return of unified data models, which means that a developer can anticipate the structure of an API JSON return without ever having read or studied that specific API documentation. \\xa0 This helps cut down on future technical debt by keeping integration code at a minimum, which in turn leads to less possible problems that may arise in the future. Think of it this way: If all of your integrations can be handled in the same amount of code that each connector would individually take to implement, then you can eliminate technical debt from integrations by a factor of however many different cloud services you plan to connect to. On top of that, when these services change their response structure or means of access, a unified API handles all of that refactoring on their side so that your codebase is insured against unforeseen future instances of code-breaking changes. By integrating with a unified API, you can also address your global integration technical debt entirely, as your applications integrations will be available and future-proofed across all access layers of your app. If one service makes any code-breaking changes in the future, all of your application layers that require access to that integration will suffer. With a unified API, every layer with access to a service can rest assured that the integrations will remain sound for the foreseeable future. Land the Technical Debt Knockout Punch Technical debt should not be treated as a failure of the past. In fact, delivering your product on time should be paramount, and minimal technical debt is entirely fine. Making sure that it stays away from the architectural level should always be a priority, but making quick decisions and implementations for the sake of deployment is absolutely acceptable if your plan is to fix it sooner than later.\\xa0',\n",
       "  \"Witness: Tristan Harris. Chair: Good morning. Welcome to this further session of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee inquiry into disinformation and fake news. Tristan Harris, thank you for joining us from Paris this morning to give evidence. I appreciate that you have a pretty busy schedule today, and I believe you are meeting President Macron later this afternoon. Is that correct? Tristan Harris: This morning. Thank you for grabbing me am really excited to get all this information out there. Q3147\\xa0 Chair: That great. Many people, in speaking about Facebook in particular, have said that they believe that the early success of Facebook was based on the extraordinary amount of time people spent on the site, which made it quite an outlier compared with other platforms. Perhaps you could explain, for the record and the benefit of the Committee, how the addictive quality of Facebook has been such an important part of its success. Tristan Harris: Sure. I guess, if it is helpful, I could give you a taste of my background in answering this question. It is an important lens to have. We often see people who use Facebook as making a conscious choice of the 150 times a day people check their phones, which we often think of as 150 conscious choices. When I was a kid I was a magician, and that teaches you to see this word  in a very different way. The whole premise is that, by controlling people attention, you can control their choices.  The thing about magic is important, because it really speaks to the framing for all the issues we are going to talk about today that it works on all human minds, no matter what language they speak, no matter how old or young they are, and no matter whether they are educated or not. In fact, if they have a PhD, they are usually easier to manipulate. In other words, there are facts about the hardware of the human mind, and that gives you a reference point for asking,  there facts about how to manipulate and influence any human mind that your audience won know? The answer is, of course, yes.  There is a set of techniques that are used in the tech industry under the guise of creating engagement that mask other problems like addiction. They are basically about hijacking the deeper underlying instincts of the human mind. A simple example, which you have probably seen before, is the slot machine, which has a variable schedule of rewards. A slot machine handles addictive qualities by playing to a specific kind of pattern in a human mind. It offers a reward when a person pulls a lever. There is a delay, which is a variable might be quick or long. The reward might be big or small. It is the randomness that creates the addiction.  Whenever you open up, say, Facebook, you do not know what you are going to get. You are literally opening it up and playing a slot machine to see,  is it going to show me from my friends lives today? When you click on notifications you tap that red notification box are playing a slot machine to see,  am I going to get? Every time you scroll, you might as well be playing a slot machine, because you are not sure what is going to come up next on the page. A slot machine is a very simple, powerful technique that causes people to want to check in all the time. Facebook and Twitter, by being social products using your social network an infinite supply of new information that they could show you. There are literally thousands of things that they could populate that news feed with, which turns it into that random-reward slot machine. That is one technique. Another one is something called stopping cues, which are like what a magician does. How do I know when to stop drinking this glass of water? Well, it has a bottom is a stopping cue that my mind has to wake up and ask,  I really want more water? If I wanted people not to think about that and to manipulate their choices, I might remove that stopping cue. This is related to a study in which six people were sat down at a table with different bowls of soup. Two had a tube at the bottom that refilled the bowl with more soup as they were drinking it, and the others did not. The question was,  you remove the stopping cue and the bowl of soup doesn finish, will people just continue eating? The answer was yes. I think they consumed 76% more calories. The reason I bring this up is that the way social media products are designed is that they want to take out the bottom want to take out the stopping cue the usage. The reason that there are these infinitely scrolling news feeds is that they act, basically, like a bottomless bowl of content, and you do not want a mind to wake up and think for itself,  do I want to stop doing this? I am enumerating just a few techniques that are taught at conferences and in books like  that basically teach you,  are different ways of influencing people choices. Together, they create what we are calling addiction. I think the word  is not a very helpful word, because it makes it seem as if there are lots of substances that are addictive, such as tobacco and alcohol, and phones are just another thing that is addictive. It is more nuanced than that, because behind the screen are 100 engineers who know a lot more about how your mind works than you do. They play all these different tricks every single day and update those tricks to keep people hooked. There are many more techniques that I could go into, but that is probably a good entrÃ©e. I will give one more example, which is more about how Facebook would do it. Let us say that there is a user who goes dormant for a while. There is a user who was active, and then they stop using the product and use it not at all for a week. If I am Facebook and I want to reactivate that user, using social psychology, I can see that Damian has been browsing Facebook and just looked at a photo that includes that user. Now, I am going to pop up a little notification that says,  Damian, do you want to tag your friend dormant user this photo? It is just a quick yes/no question. You are sitting there, and you think,  sure, why not? So you hit yes. This dormant user then gets an email saying,  friend Damian tagged you in this photo. It makes it seem as though Damian made his own independent choice, when in fact Facebook is kind of a puppet master. It gets one person to tag someone in a photo so that this dormant user has to come back to Facebook. It is very powerful. It taps into their social approval, their vanity and their social validation. They have to come back and see the photo they were tagged in. It is very powerful.  I am not saying that Facebook does that exact thing specifically, but there are variations on those kinds of techniques that are used across Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and LinkedIn. LinkedIn does it a lot with getting you to invite other people to LinkedIn that you have emailed with recently. This is the entire environment that we have immersed human minds in. There are more than 2 billion people who use Facebook, which is about the number of conventional followers of Christianity. There are about 1.8 billion users of YouTube, which is about the number of conventional followers of Islam. People check their phones about 150 times a day in the developed world millennials. These things have a totalising surface area over people lives. They spend huge amounts of their time on them. The amount of time they spend is not an accident of,  no, we made it addictive. We could never have predicted that. Actually, there is a deliberate set of techniques that can be used to create that addiction and that time-spent usage. Q3148\\xa0 Chair: When Mark Zuckerberg appeared in front of the Senate, he was famously asked how he made money out of a service that was free, and he said in a very clear way that Facebook runs ads. Do you think, regardless of the intentions of Mark Zuckerberg when Facebook started, that the company has become addicted to capturing as much of the attention of its users as possible so that it can run more ads against that audience? Tristan Harris: That is a great question. My experience and knowledge of the industry should say that I am from Silicon Valley, I am the same age as Zuckerberg and I was at Stanford University when Facebook was getting started, so a lot of my friends worked there in the early days. I have a lot of experience of people who are in the industry, the things that motivate them and how they thought about these kinds of issues.  To answer your question, I do not think that in the beginning there was this evil, aggressive idea of,  are going to steal as much of people attention as possible, or,  have to make so much money, because of advertising. In fact, advertising in this model did not show up until much later. What really drove a lot of this was the desire to win and grow. In Silicon Valley, there are teams called growth hackers. Growth hackers are basically the magician teams or the psychological manipulation teams. Chamath Palihapitiya was the famous one from Facebook who came out saying basically that the  feedback loops we have created are ruining the fabric of society He stepped back from Facebook.  The teams are incentivised how their role is measured inside the companies is based on how much growth they can drive. Their job is to figure out what the new species of notifications are. They have to think,  are the new kinds of things we can do to email people to seduce them to come back to the product? What are the new techniques we can add to the design of the product? Do we need a red coloured button or a blue button? Say they want consent for the GDPR and users have to click a consent button on the product. They say,  change the choice architecture. We will wait to show you the consent box on a day that you are urgently looking for the address of that place you have to go to. We will put the big blue consent box on top of that place so you basically have to hit consent. Q3149\\xa0 Chair: There is a case in China, I believe, where video games companies have required or not, they have done it the algorithms of some of their games to make them less addictive, so that players aren rewarded for extended periods of play. Do you think something similar should be looked at for social media platforms such as Facebook, so that people are not rewarded as they are currently for engaging with the platform as much as they do? Tristan Harris: Yes, Facebook has said themselves they adopted Time Well Spent they were able to reduce the amount of time people spent on Facebook. I think it was something like 50 million hours that they were reducing usage by achieved by the design. For example, Facebook can make the news feed as addictive as possible a spectrum, and they control how far along the spectrum they want to go. They could make it so that it is maximally addictive or least addictive. For example, they currently sort the news feed based on,  are the things that I can tell you that most cause you to want to keep scrolling? They have a machine casting billions of variations of this across these billions of human animals, and they get to figure out that these are the things that kind of work, and these are the things that don work. On that spectrum, they could set the mark way over here at maximum addiction, or they could set the mark so that if they decide to get the captive audience less interested, they would show you the more boring cat photos of your friend life, which you are not interested in. They set the dial; they don want to admit that they set the dial, and instead they keep claiming,  a neutral platform, or,  a neutral tool, but in fact every choice they make is a choice architecture. They are designing how compelling the thing that shows up next on the news feed is, and their admission that they can already change the news feeds so that people spend less time shows that they do have control of that. The core change and shift in responsibility needs to be to,  not up to us, the user, to use this product differently from,  you are having a problem with it, it your problem. You have to not use it as much  free choice you don like this product, there is a different one or,  a free choice you addicted, just have more self-control, use it differently. Instead, they need to see it as their responsibility. It not just about the time spent not the core part. The key thing about the addiction is that it is almost like it sets up the matrix. Now you have 2 billion people with this addictive element, and social psychology and all this puppet master stuff knocking about. That kind of sets up the 2 billion-person matrix where now everyone is jacked in, because from the moment they wake up in the morning and turn their alarm off, they start seeing things that come from other companies, to the moment they go to bed, when they set their alarms but keep themselves jacked into a 24-hour cycle sets up the first layer, although my concern is less about the addiction than about what this then does when people thoughts and beliefs are propagated through society by the fact that you so effectively hijacked 2 billion human beings into this system. Q3150\\xa0 Chair: A lot of our work in this inquiry has looked at the impact of Facebook on political campaigns, and the spreading of information about issues and events. Is this something that you have looked at? Do you feel that maybe this is something that has taken Facebook by surprise they were not aware of how open their platform was to being exploited by people who wish to spread disinformation or highly partisan content? Tristan Harris: I am very interested in this issue and have studied it. Facebook has been aware of the spread of certain kinds of information for a long time. They have had efforts, stretching back years, to work on clickbait, dramatically reducing the kinds of things that were just sensational at the kind of language patterns used in headlines, the way that people write those headlines to get the most clicks try and disincentivise those things from showing up at the top of news feeds. So they have been aware of that for a long time. What has happened now is that there is divisive and incendiary speech, combined with clickbaity-style headlines that have gone through. It has been shown through different research that there is an intrinsic bias in favour of a word that is the most sensational, the most divisive and the most incendiary. Someone who works with us at the Center for Humane Technology, Guillaume Chaslot, was a YouTube engineer who showed that YouTube systematically rewards the more divisive, conspiracy-theory-engaging speech. For example, a pattern like,  destroys Trump in debate language pattern,  destroys B in debate be recommended at the top of the recommendations in YouTube so that, over time, if you airdropped a person on to a random video of Hillary and Trump, two videos later you would be in one of the more extreme ones. He showed that if you airdropped on to a regular video about 9/11, two videos later on autoplay it will put you into a 9/11 conspiracy theory video. If you airdrop a human being into YouTube and they land on a regular moon landing video from the 1960s, two videos later, they are in flat Earth conspiracy theories. So there is an intrinsic bias of these platforms to reward whatever is most engaging, because engagement is in both the business model and the growth strategy.  If I am Facebook, I will probably say,  these guys at the Center for Humane Technology may think we are all about the advertising business model, but we do not even optimise for revenue. But they do optimise for engagement. They just said it in the last week. The guy who ran the news feed said that they do optimise for daily active users. If they are going to keep coming back every single day, which is how they measure success, and they have to grow that effort, then they have to show you engaging things. If it is not engaging, they cannot keep a business going. That is the core problem behind all of this: we have put this kind of Pavlovian Skinner box thing in people pockets where you play slot machines all the time, and it is sorting what it shows you by  engaging so it is this race to the bottom of the brain stem, to the bottom of the lizard brain, to activate our core instincts.  Even if one company does not want to grow the amount of attention that it has you are Facebook and you just have 30 minutes of people day, and you don want to grow 30 minutes, you just want to hold on to that 30 minutes guess what? Years go on and months go on and there are more and more competitive threats because there is only so much attention out there: Facebook is competing with YouTube is competing with Discord is competing with TBH is competing with Reddit. As more and more things show up, they can get attention the way they got it yesterday have to get more and more aggressive, so they start adding slot machines, the puppet controls, the bottomless bowl and things like that. It gets more and more persuasive over time, which is why we are feeling, as a species, across the world, that we are losing agency and we are feeling more addicted. It is because every year each of these companies has to reach deeper down in the brain stem to hijack us at a deeper sociological level.  It goes very deep because it is not just our behavioural addictions. It is not just behaviour modification. You can also go deeper down to people identity and self-worth. For example, Snapchat has taken over the currency of whether or not kids believe that they are friends with each other. Keep in mind that Snapchat is one of the No. 1 ways that teenagers in the United States, and abroad, communicate. It is very, very popular. Snapchat and Instagram are the two most popular products. The way that kids feel like they are friends with each other is whether or not they have been able to keep up their streak, which shows the number of days in a row that they have sent messages back and forth with each of their friends.  In other words, if you have two friends, a third party puppet master made these two human beings feel like they are only friends if they keep that 156-days-in-a-row streak going, so now it is 157 days in a row that they have sent a message. It is like tying two kids on two treadmills, tying legs together with string and hitting start on both treadmills, so now both those kids are running and they keep sending the football back and forth every single day, and if they don the other one falls off the thing that has fallen down is not the other kid, it is their friendship. Kids actually believe on a self-worth level, or a social approval level, or a social validation level, when they are very vulnerable on that stage, that they can only keep up their friendship if they continue doing that. That is all orchestrated by the companies.  I think that we have to see that there are many different issues emerging out of the attention economy. The externalities range from public health, addiction, culture, children wellbeing, mental wellbeing, loneliness, sovereignty of identity and things like that to election, democracy, truth, discernment of truth and a shared reality, anti-trust and power. There are multiple issues. There are even more, because when you control the minds of people, you control society. How people make sense of the world and how they make choices are what ID is, and that can affect every aspect of society. Q3151\\xa0 Chair: A brief final question from me before I bring in other members of the Committee. From what you are saying, on the political side the danger is that no matter how people start to engage with political content, the platform will direct them to more extreme versions of whatever it is they have started to look at, because that is the way you maintain people engagement.  Tristan Harris: Yes. I don have specific evidence about what Facebook does to do that, but in general, if you just look at it as a game theoretic situation, each actor is locked into needing to be more and more persuasive and engaging. They have to be persuasive over time. Netflix recommendations have to get better and more perfect; YouTube wants to make you forget why you came to YouTube and what you wanted to do originally, and instead make you go to the next video on YouTube, and that is going to get stronger and stronger over time. Tinder wants to show you one more perfect reason why you shouldn be with the person you with, and Facebook wants to show you one more engaging article. This is only going to continue, which is why we need to change course.  The structure of the larger conversation is about how you make that work, and instead build on human nature, which is fixed. We are living inside an increasingly adversarial environment in which super-computers are pointed at our brains playing chess against our minds, and trying to figure out what move they could make inside the chessboard of our mind, and what is the most engaging thing, before we even know what happened. That is the reason why we go to YouTube and we think,  watch just one video and then I go back to my work Suddenly we wake up two hours later and we are like,  the hell happened? It is because it was playing chess against your mind, and it knew there was a video it could show you before you knew that that video would keep you for the next two hours. Again, the background trend is engagement.  Chair: Thank you. I will bring in other members of the Committee. It is possible that some people might be off screen for you, but hopefully you will bear with us.  Q3152\\xa0 Ian C. Lucas:\\xa0 Thank you. Tristan, what do you think that the platforms fear most from legislators? Tristan Harris: That a great question. They fear any kind of regulation because they are obviously thinking about its value. They fear anything that would slow them down because they need to grow fast.  Q3153\\xa0 Ian C. Lucas: What do you think the legislators should be doing? You have outlined some quite harrowing evidence concerning young people. What should legislators be doing in that area? Tristan Harris: I think there are several things. Fundamentally, this is a whole new class of political, social and economic actors. We know what a bank is, and we know how to regulate a bank. Banks do one thing. We know what health products do because we live inside the health domain. When you have a new tranche of products, they are not just products are basically societal environments. They are the public sphere; they are democratic norms; they are election laws.  The way to think about this am zooming out first before I answer your specific question Marc Andreessen insight that technology can do every industry more efficiently than anything that can be done without technology. We have given the tech sector a free pass on regulation. The phrase  is eating the world means that deregulation is eating the world. Just take media and advertising. In the United States laws prohibit certain kinds of political advertising pricing for political advertising on TV and so on. When software eats that, it eats it up and you have Facebook running that infrastructure. You just took away all the protections. There is no more regulation for any of the things that we used to have regulation for.  In every single sector, whether that is media, advertising, children health, what we allow children to see, data privacy that stuff have to reintroduce that in the digital landscape. One thing you can think about is, in all areas where technology is eating up parts of society in different industries, what were the protections that we had in place that we would need to re-establish in that part of the digital world? For example, I don know how it works in the UK, but in the US we have fair pricing for election ads. It should cost the same for each candidate to run an ad at the same time in the same TV slot. That is regulated by the FCC. On Facebook that is not true. In fact, at the last election there is some private information showing that there would be a 17 to one difference in the cost of ads for one party versus another. That is one example. Take all your laws that protect children, elections, media and ask,  are the ways in which you are stripping us of those protections and what would it take to reintroduce that? That is going to put it on some companies. But more than that, that is kind of table pick is like, what do we lose when we introduce all these things? Then there is the new class of threats for which we didn have regulations on previous domains. We didn have that new class of threat. A good example is micro-targeted advertising. So long as I can target you, based on something about you that you don know that I can target, I can find conspiracy theorists in the language of a country that I don speak but I can know that that country has conspiracy theory beliefs around don know, I can make it up. Then I can go to that country and start amplifying those conspiracy theorists and I can do it all the way from here in the United States, from Paris, from Malaysia, from anywhere. That is a new kind of threat that we haven needed regulations for in the past, because we didn have that class of threat. I personally believe that we need a ban on micro-targeted advertising. I think there is no way in which Facebook can control the exponentially complex set of things that people let advertisers enter into the platforms to target users baseline. For example, basically engineers only speak so many languages and they are stirring the pot of 2 billion people who have languages that they don even speak, including in very emergent sensitive markets where they have just got the internet like in Myanmar and Sri Lanka. It is possible for people to create culture wars in those languages because there is much less oversight by Facebook and different parties for how that is happening. I think that is one of the areas that we are going to need regulation on micro-targeting of advertising. We are going to need to reclass what these services are reclassing the legal status of what these services are. If I asked you,  is Facebook? Is it a technology, is it a social network product, therefore it is in the same category as other social networking products, basically an advertising company? Or is it an AI company? These are different ways to see what Facebook is. I would argue, right now, Facebook is being governed by the wrong kind of law, which is contract law, meaning peer-to-peer. You are a user, you hit okay, and you sign on the dotted line, therefore if something happens, like something goes wrong, or your data doesn work or you don want it to go, or you get advertising for something that you didn know, or pressure or something like that. Too bad, because you have already signed on the dotted line. You have accepted these evolving terms and conditions. If you don remember accepting, then we will get you to reaccept and we will do it again on a day when you have to accept it. You probably won think about it. They really good at doing it that way. There are hundreds of engineers making sure we hit that big blue okay button. That is a peer-to-peer contract relationship. Instead, what we need to have is a fiduciary relationship. A fiduciary relationship is where one party has the ability to exploit another party because they have asymmetric powers of an attorney-client relationship. The attorney knows more about the law than you do and you give them all this personal information that can completely exploit your interests. If the attorney does exploit the interests of the other party, they can just say,  signed on the dotted line, so it your fault, because you agreed to it Of course, we say that an attorney has a different status because they have asymmetric power over their client. It the same way that a psychotherapist can exploit you in the ways that are amenable to needing protection. That is also a fiduciary relationship. If you wind up how much power an attorney has over their client, how much power a psychotherapist has over a client, next to how much power Facebook has much does it know about how to exploit the user compared with those other two examples? Based on that alone, it is orders of magnitude. It is like a priest in a confession booth who is listening to 2 billion people confessions, the same priest, except they know the confession that you don even know you are making, because they pointed AIs at your brain and they know what colours, buttons and words light up your brain. And they know every conversation you have ever had with anybody else on Facebook. Their entire business model is to sell access to that confession booth to a third party. That is an enormous problem, in that we should never allow priests in confession booths to have a business model of selling that to a third party. To me, that instantly indicates that the advertising business model is a no-go, for something with that kind of asymmetric power to exploit people. It is one thing for them to claim,  care about our users, but its business model is explicitly to enable anyone, including Russia and foreign state actors, to manipulate the populations of anyone in that confession booth. The worst part is that people do not even realise they are in that confession booth.  People also do not realise that it is a priest with a supercomputer by their side, which is making calculations and predictions about confessions you are going to make that you don know you are going to make. There was an article in The Intercept about Facebook long-term business model, which is about the ability to tell advertisers about when you are going to churn or not be loyal to something before you know you are not going to be loyal to something.  This is an enormous and new species of power that we have never seen before, and we have to have sensible ways of reining in that power. We have to do it in a geopolitical context, knowing that other companies in China and elsewhere will have similar kinds of power, so we have to think very carefully about what it means. But at the very least, in the same way that banks have a fiduciary responsibility to the people they serve because they have asymmetric knowledge and the ability to exploit them, we have to think about that for these social media companies Facebook. Q3154\\xa0 Rebecca Pow: Thank you very much for joining us. I wanted to ask you something quickly. You touched on the health aspects of some of the things you think Facebook might be causing. In a word or two, do you actually think Facebook is dangerous to children health? Tristan Harris: Is it dangerous to public health? It is less about Facebook and more about the model. There are probably some specific ways in which Facebook endangers parts of public health, but before I go there let me just think about it. I think about it this way: we are evolved animals and we have a limited brain, a limited mind and certain vulnerabilities that work on us. If you took a human animal and put it in a cage, and when it woke up you made it look at photos in sequence of its friends having fun without it after photo after photo of its friends having fun without it would have an impact on any human being. If I could show you photo after photo of your ex-romantic partner smiling with someone new, that would have an impact on your mental wellbeing.  The question is, how have we designed this environment that surrounds 2 billion human animals? Because this business model of engagement and these products such as Instagram photos are much more engaging in many cases than Facebook and just lots of posts, especially for younger generations are basically surrounding human beings with evidence that is actually false. We are constructing a magic trick, a false social reality of the highlight reels of our friends lives.  Q3155\\xa0 Rebecca Pow: Do you think there would be any way of analysing that, so that you could prove that this model was causing a danger to society? I only ask because that might help us to target this if we need to. Tristan Harris: I sorry, I didn hear the very beginning of that.  Q3156\\xa0 Rebecca Pow: Earlier, you said that 2 billion people minds were being hijacked through this system. We have to come up with some recommendations if we think this is a danger; if this is one of the aspects that is a danger to society, how are we going to measure that to prove it? Is there any way of doing that? Tristan Harris: It is a challenge. It will be very much like sugar and tobacco. Let take sugar as an example for social psychology and health. Sugar will always taste really good, even after we know it is bad for us. We cannot beat the fact that it tastes good for us. We can increase the price of it, but it will always be in our food supply. Social validation and social approval will never go away. They are like sugar, especially for younger people. It is more a product of a public and cultural awakening to the fact that this has such a tremendous impact on us. For as long as we are surrounded by evidence of our friends having fun without us, it is very hard to regulate that and say that people should not be surrounded by that. I just think people need to know that, actually, it is going to have that negative impact, and there is going to be a cost on our lives; and the costs do show up in analysis attention and cognition. More frequently switching between tasks and forth, multi-tasking our IQ. It has been show that when we get interruptions in a work context it takes us 23 minutes to resume focus after an interruption. We cycle between two or three other projects, usually, before we get back to the thing that we are doing; so every time you get distracted by a Youtube video, or something like that, you don just go right back to working and you are right back in the flow. You check your email and you do something else, and something else, and then you get back to maybe starting to get back in the flow. The costs are about so many different layers of society. Q3157\\xa0 Rebecca Pow: So who would this be a role for academics or regulators; or, indeed, should we be interfering at all? I only give this example because in the UK we have just brought down the limit on gambling machines  limit of the dangers of gambling. You could say is this a similar thing, and how on earth do we pinpoint it to say this is a danger? Tristan Harris: On the gambling thing, I think that what we need are certain standards at the very least, and this is something that we are advocating for with our organisation humane design standards. So, for example, how should a phone or an object that sits up against the human skin of 2 billion people not operate like a slot machine. If we knew the threshold by which at a certain frequency of dosing out these little rewards of dopamine, that that creates addiction, can we set a threshold or a standard by which mobile phone manufacturers would want to stay underneath the threshold for trying to be this dopamine-and-slot-machine-style incentive? That is kind of like what we do in gambling; I don know all the limitations but I know that the Nevada Gaming Commission and other organisations are trying to set a standard for how slot machines work, so that it has to be genuinely random house can always win. There are certain kinds of mathematical standards.  The challenge here is more complex and messy, because it is not as if Apple and Google, who make the phone themselves, are trying to set up what that dopamine slot machine thing is. It is that they created an environment in which, with all these apps competing, the apps act like slot machines. So it is going to take redesigning it from an OS level, from Apple and Google, to be more considerate; and there is a shareholder letter to Apple right now about the toxic public health problems that emerge from addiction, for children especially I think that conversation needs to be amplified. I will say that Google recently announced the Google wellbeing initiative, which is just baby steps, honestly, in starting to answer these kinds of questions. What we really want to do is turn this from a race to the bottom of the brain stem to capture attention to a race to the top of the marketplace where people protect and care about users about people.  Q3158\\xa0 Rebecca Pow: Apparently, Tristan, it has been shown that addictive gamblers don want to win; they just want more time on the machine, so would not that actually be playing into Facebook hands kind of addiction? Tristan Harris: What was the bit about more time on the machine? Q3159\\xa0 Rebecca Pow: Sorry, I probably wasn facing the microphone. It has been shown that addictive gamblers don want to win. They want greater time on the device. So wouldn that actually be what is happening on Facebook as well? That actually then plays into the hands of Facebook, because then you are going to be targeting them with more adverts and more of the stuff you want to indoctrinate them with.  Tristan Harris: I am sorry; the audio quality didn come in super-clearly, so I didn hear all of that: something about how Facebook could benefit from some kind of regulation around gambling in the same way that we can creatively that what it was about? Q3160\\xa0 Rebecca Pow: Shall I just repeat it one more time; I do not know if this microphone is working properly? It has been shown that addictive gamblers actually just want more time on the device. That is what they want. They are addicted to using the device; so isn that actually what is happening on Facebook? The more they use it, the more they are addicted, and the harder it is going to be for anyone to come up with a plan or a policy to get them out of that addiction. Tristan Harris: Yes, exactly; and in the case of gambling you have to at least drive a few miles in a car, as a gambler, to do that. We can say there is some amount of responsibility that a person has in that gap of choice making, where they really have to make a conscious choice. In the case of smartphones, you don get to choose. There are ways in which the slot machine is kind of built right next to your alarm clock, so right when you turn off the alarm on your phone are right there in the app switcher. They are already open oftentimes, or there are notifications there. This challenge is about regulating choice architectures and how we enable people to have the agency to at least have the freedom to put slot machines far away from them, and also to regulate how they work and how addicted they are, versus being in a world where they cannot control how close or far away from them those slot machines are. A good and slightly different example of this is that blue light screws up our circadian rhythms as human animals. When you look at screens and see the light that comes out white, shiny, bright light has blue light in it. If you look at that late at night, it actually has an impact on your circadian rhythms, and you don get to choose that. In this space, Apple introduced something called night shift and Google introduced some night setting modes to basically strip the colour out of the screen, or to turn it into greyscale.  These are the kinds of things that, if we really cared about people, we would design them to align with our human biology. A slot machine redesign would do the same thing. We would say that, given that human beings are vulnerable to being dosed with dopamine rewards at a certain rate, we would have to design it differently, so that it wouldn interact with human biology in that manipulative way. I am not sure if that helps, but I am trying to answer the question. Q3161\\xa0 Rebecca Pow: Can I just ask one final question? Facebook have already made some changes to their policies and their privacy policies and all of that. Do you think that that is effective? Have they made enough changes? Should we leave it up to them, or should we interfere and bring in regulation? Tristan Harris: Did you ask whether they have made enough changes and whether regulation is needed? The audio quality is not perfect. Rebecca Pow: Yes. Facebook have already brought in some changes, on a voluntary basis, to transform their structure and business model. Do you think that is enough? Tristan Harris: This is a question about self-regulation. I would love for the industry to self-regulate to the full extent that it needs to. The challenge, which I think we have all noticed, is that, when given the opportunity to regulate themselves, they haven done nearly enough.  It took years for them to make the simple changes, which they announced recently, around Time Well Spent to try to reduce the amount of time that people spend on Facebook. That involved a lot of people like me trying to raise awareness about the negative public health consequences that emerged. They don do these things until there is a huge cultural pushback, and they generally wait until the last minute. For the Irish referendum, they only made changes on ads to protect that election about a week or something before the election. With the Russia investigation in the United States, they only released the number of people who were actually affected million day before they had Congressional hearings.  In terms of being transparent and accountable, we don seem to be able to trust Facebook, at least, very much with what they are doing. We need proactive responsibility, not reactive, which is why we might need regulations. Those would be very hard to figure out, especially for a general Government agency. We need more specific expertise areas to provide oversight of these companies. If they have that expertise, they can help to start crafting some of these regulations. Q3162\\xa0 Giles Watling: Thank you for coming and talking to us this morning, Tristan. In many ways, the evidence you have given us this morning is amazing. I would like a video on the sort of evidence you have been giving to be regularly shown on prime-time television, so that we can all clue in to exactly what addicts us to these things.  You said about joining something like Facebook or one of the other social media platforms that people want to join in and see their friends, and that they won see the videos that they want to watch unless they agree to the terms and conditions. That is almost forcing them to agree to terms and conditions that they won necessarily read; in fact, I don believe that many people actually do. Am I right in saying that that is the way that it is designed to hook people in? Tristan Harris: Yes. In the growth-hacking world, one strategy is to get someone friend to tag them in a photo, so that someone who is not yet on Facebook receives an email saying that their friend has tagged a photo of them. They are not on Facebook yet, so to see the photo they have to sign up for Facebook. That is not something that Facebook specifically does, but it is a technique that is part of the growth-hacking literature on how technology companies grow their products. It is to try to create rewards that can only be accessed by signing up for the service and agreeing to the terms of service. Again, in a moment where I most need to access, let us say, the address of a Facebook event I am going to tonight, and when I open up the app on that occasion I am in a rush, if that is the day that the GDPR with a long list of new policies comes up with a big blue button, I am not going to think about the blue button or what it said. I am just going to get to that address. We need a new understanding, from a regulation of consent, in which people have less and less time and are doing things in more and more urgent situations, especially on phones, to a regulation of default settings. We need default settings and default rules that work better for more people. Public education, for example.  Q3163\\xa0 Giles Watling: Could we remove that in a regulatory way? Could we dismantle this system of set-up so that when you engage, you can just engage? You do not have to agree. You can just engage or go away. You do not have to agree. Is that what you are saying default setting? Tristan Harris: Yes, I see what you are saying. There could be certain standards of access, almost like net neutrality or something where you can access core things without needing to sign up. I think that is the kind of thing you are getting at. Companies would certainly not be happy with that little drop in their sign-up rate and growth rates, but that would be something interesting to look at. Q3164\\xa0 Giles Watling: We have had the gambling analogy, and there is another analogy. I would like to know whether you agree with it. It is like the tobacco industry, which, in many ways, was kind of a perfect industry. Tobacco is really cheap to produce. Everybody gets addicted. You can then begin to charge what you like and then it takes generations to kick the habit. The western world has largely kicked that habit and we are moving towards a tobacco-free environment. Everywhere we go now is tobacco-free. Can you see that as a future for this kind of addiction online? Tristan Harris: That right, and I want to get to something else you say in that, which is that this is like a new species of tobacco. This is like a tobacco that has an AI engine inside of it that is updating how it works to perfectly match your specific human weaknesses and psychological vulnerabilities. It uses your social psychology and your dependence on your friends and your need for belonging to make it, so it is impossible. I have studied cults in my background in studying persuasion, and that is what cults do. You control the currency of belonging. Once I am in and my friends are all part of that group, I cannot derive my belonging from anywhere else; you have got me. Let us say as an example that I am a teenager and I am listening to Tristan and I say,  I realise I don want to use Snapchat any more; it trying to manipulate me. It just addictive. I am a teenager, I am 15 years old, I live in the UK and I don want to use Snapchat, but guess what? In the case of Facebook, for example, or in the case of the Snapchat people, if my friends are only talking about where they are going to hang out on a Tuesday night on Snapchat and they didn use anything else, I have just cut off my access to belonging. I have cut off my access to social opportunities, sexual opportunities and development opportunities, in the same way that if I don use LinkedIn. Once they own the currency of finding a job, I have to use LinkedIn. In the Facebook case, there are teachers who assign their homework through Facebook. If a user says,  don want to use Facebook but then suddenly their homework is assigned through Facebook and that is where the classwork and sessions happen, then that person has to use it. So that is the challenge. Capturing our social psychology is what is new about these services rather than just being backup. Q3165\\xa0 Giles Watling: I afraid I old enough to remember that it was a social thing to smoke. If you were outside the circle, you were not taking a cigarette, and you went into a social situation, you were always offered cigarettes. I afraid that is how it was and this seems very similar to me. I want to ask one final question if I may. It was said about you that you were the closest thing that Silicon Valley had to a conscience. Do you think you are pretty much alone out there? Do you think there are other people moving towards improving the way these platforms work in Silicon Valley? Tristan Harris: It a great question. We are trying to create a movement here and we are trying to say that this has gone really horribly wrong. It is not because we are evil people. In fact, a lot of people in the tech industry have good intentions. We are trying to collect those who have a conscience and who really do see that we need to do things a different way and are willing to face the fact that it might require a different business model to do things a different way. That movement has been growing. Many insiders inside these technology companies are big fans of this work and the need for change. Chris Hughes, the co-founder of Facebook, recently became a supporter of our work has endorsed our work and is an adviser. Roger McNamee, who was Mark Zuckerberg mentor and introduced Mark and Sheryl at Facebook, and I were part of starting the Center for Humane Technology. There is a set of characters that are increasingly coming out of the woodwork we are concerned about the long-term cost and damage that this is going to do if we don fix it. So, I think this is a movement and it takes more people coming out. That has been happening progressively, the more people who have been coming out.  Q3166\\xa0 Giles Watling: And those people now will work with us work with regulatory bodies, you feel?  Tristan Harris: I sorry some reason, the beginning of what you are saying is always very quiet Giles Watling: That group you were just describing who are coming out of the woodwork are developing a conscience, if you like be prepared to work with regulatory bodies?  Tristan Harris: That right, yes. Our goal is to become helpful and a resource for companies that already exist to change their business models, design practices, develop standards to be a resource for Governments to develop sensible, common-sense policies and protections that really deal with these problems. That is why I am here with you right now; that is what our goal is.  Q3167\\xa0 Brendan O'Hara: Thank you, Tristan. It is fascinating testimony that you are giving. As a father of two teenage daughters, I have witnessed the emotional angst that is involved in the ending of a long-running streak on Instagram. It sounds ridiculous, but it is true, and I can witness that what you are saying is absolutely correct.  I would like to ask you a bit about Facebook. Every time you have spoken to Facebook, all the way up to Mike Schroepfer, they have always said like a mantra never thought, when we started Facebook, that we would end up in this position That may well be true, but if it is true, in your opinion, how far down the road was Facebook when they realised that this is exactly where they were headed? What choices and decisions did they take at that point, which took them to where they are now?  Tristan Harris: That is a great question. In terms of how much they knew, it is important to say again I did not work at Facebook. I know many who did. I think that in their addiction to growth and global domination, they have an almost fraternity you know mindset. Like it, grow, move fast and break things, done is better than perfect. When you go to the company and see the posters on the walls, those are the kinds of statements that you see. They very much have a growth-orientated mindset, more so than anything else. There is also an invisible libertarian bias, that it is not our responsibility how these products we make affect things, affect the world. We are just building a product that can come to you, the user: it is up to you, the society, to choose how you will use this neutral object that we have created. I have always thought that that was not true at all. The presentation, for reference, that I gave at Google in 2013 made a slide deck that was viral. That is how I came to be doing this synapticist sort of work. Basically, what I claimed was a moral responsibility that Google had in shaping 2 billion people attention and that we had an important moral responsibility to get that right and to think about the consequences of what would happen downstream from designing the products. In terms of when Facebook realised that, I think that it should have been obvious years earlier.  Here is the problem: as an engagement-based model, you just want to see the numbers go up. If you think about it, Facebook is 2 billion people doing billions of actions every day, billions of clicks. So the only way you have of understanding what is happening inside your 2 billion-person country called Facebook is by using metrics measuring how many things are happening. So, you measure a few things. What do you measure? When your business model is advertising, you care about how many accounts were created. You just want that number to go up, and you don really care whether those accounts are real accounts are not, or Russian trolls, or bots, or fake accounts, or sock puppets. You just want accounts to go up, and then you want content to go up: how much content is getting posted on the platform?  YouTube just says,  many videos were uploaded? Facebook says,  many posts were created? You want to count how many friend connections are created and how much time spent was going up spent is the biggest indicator for engagement. You innocuously start to pay attention to those core, simple naive metrics. That is what caused the problem. They had all the user growth numbers go up, but they did not check whether they were real or Russian. They had all the advertiser campaigns go up, but they did not know that there might be nefarious bad actors, who might be using it deliberately to create culture wars.  In having all the content generated on YouTube, they do not know whether those are just conspiracy theories and people are trying to deliberately manipulate populations of people. They just want activity and growth at all costs. I really think that is a lapse of consciousness and responsibility, because to me it does not take an enormous amount of insight to see what kind of impact they will have downstream.  In fact, I do not know if this person is coming to your Committee, but Antonio GarcÃ\\xada MartÃ\\xadnez, who worked at Facebook, said that they used to joke that if they wanted to, they could steer elections. Facebook and Google probably both know before any election happens who will win that election, because they have so much data about what everyone has been posting before every election and the analysis of positive and negative sentiments that are posted around each word. They know before any of us do on the outside where elections will go.  Knowing that they knew that years ago says to me that they would know that there are things that they could predict about where culture, mental health for teenagers, elections and manipulation will go. They should have had a much deeper awareness from the beginning; especially after the 2016 US elections and Brexit, it should have been enormously clear that they had a role in that. In my mind, the biggest evidence to me that they have not had that consciousness is how long it has taken them to get to where they are now through huge amounts of public pressure, and not through their own sense of responsibility.  Q3168\\xa0 Brendan O'Hara: One of my younger, trendier colleagues informs me that Snapchat has streaks, not Instagram, as I said. Going back to Facebook, Sandy Parakilas said when he gave evidence to the Committee that Facebook collected personally identifiable data on people who had not specifically authorised it. They then intentionally allowed that data to leave Facebook without any controls once it had left. Is that a fair assessment in your opinion?  Tristan Harris: I would trust Sandy judgment on that. I am not an expert on exactly what happened with the Cambridge Analytica and Facebook app platform, but the entire premise of Facebook app platform when they designed it was to enable third-party developers to have access to people friends data. That was the purpose of it; and that is what is missing in that debate about Cambridge Analytica. It is not that Facebook is great and the app platform was great but there was this one really evil actor called Cambridge Analytica, which took that data and they are so bad; the premise of the app platform was to enable as many developers as possible to use that data in creative ways, to build creative new social applications on behalf of Facebook. Theoretically, that would be helping to the world to be better, using Facebook data. They wanted to make that better.  For the reasons I described at the beginning about the attention economy, the app platform turned into a race for engagement. It turned into a game of garbage about how you basically manipulated people into poking each other back and listing their top friends; in this case, Cambridge Analytica filling out a personality profile to manipulate them.  We tend to focus on privacy and data a lot, and where data goes and whether people know where their data is going. We have to assume at this point that the data is out there there is a dark market where you can buy data on anybody. That information is out there. The most important thing that we do now is protect the means by which it can be used.  Just assume that there is some corner of the dark web where I can buy 2 billion people political profiles and understand the sentiments that they have ever expressed about key topics such as immigration or something like that. That is just available now. It is not going to go away; it is now just out there. Now the question is: how do we protect the ways that that gets used? Q3169\\xa0 Brendan O'Hara: What was in it for Facebook to build a platform that made data abuse so easy, and what benefits did it get from developing platforms that allowed developers to access user data in this way? Tristan Harris: In the case of the Facebook app platform, my understanding was back to the attention economy it was creating and enabling all sorts of other people to invent reasons for people to come back to Facebook. If you think of how it is now, there are thousands of popular apps on Facebook that you have to use Facebook to do. That forces people to come back to Facebook and creates more engagement for Facebook, more time spent on Facebook, and more data collection by Facebook. So much of those application platform APIs, meaning the programming interfaces that people use to build Facebook apps, would usually require that those activities and events would come back, and Facebook would see all those events.  Suddenly, they get to capture even more data. They get to capture even more activity and time spent, which is good for advertising and good for telling Wall Street. They get to capture more users. This whole thing turned into,  can we make Facebook grow? Again, I think that was really the motivation, because the app platform came out in 2008 or 2007. I think that was really about growth. They were in very early stages, and they wanted to grow the platform to be much bigger. Q3170\\xa0 Brendan O'Hara: Finally, how important is surveillance of the internet to Facebook business model? Tristan Harris: How important is data to Facebook business model? Is that what you are asking? Brendan O'Hara: Does someone else want to try asking the question? It may be this mic this accent. Q3171\\xa0 Chair: Brendan was asking about the importance of surveillance of the internet as a whole to the Facebook business model. I suppose that would include the way that Facebook monitors what people do off of Facebook, and monitors their other browsing history and sites that they visit, to support the data that they gather about those users non-users as well, obviously. Tristan Harris: For the record, it was not just the accent; it was the volume. The question I heard from the Chair was: how important is the data that is gathered offsite to Facebook business model in general? The thing about data is that it lets you do more and more prediction. I think that these companies Facebook and YouTube be seen as AI companies. They are not social networks; they are artificial intelligence systems.  The fuel for artificial intelligence systems is information that lets you do better prediction. They are specifically interested in the kinds of data that would enable them to do better predictions, and knowing that you browse certain kinds of websites is very helpful in knowing how to predict what you will be vulnerable to, what messages you will be influenced by or invulnerable to, and what advertisers might want to target you. A simple example of this that emerged in the last few years is the lookalike model am sure you are all now aware of lookalike models. If I am an advertiser and I want to find an audience and I know only about 100 people who are interested in a thing I am interested in, Facebook can calculate based on those 100 people who looks like them in their behaviour. The more data I have about their behaviour across the internet, the better I can find them on Facebook, and the more alternative lookalike users who look like that initial seed group of 100 can give you. That is one clear example of how having more data gives you access to be more and more effective for advertising.  What is really dangerous about this is that you can increasingly predict the perfect ways to influence and manipulate someone. That is what Cambridge Analytica was about, right? It is about saying that in addition to all the behaviour data you can collect, if you know people by personality traits you can influence them to an even greater degree.  I wanted to bring up the point that data has been important, but there will be other creative ways to learn things about people, even if they do not give you that information explicitly. There is a study by Gloria Mark at UC Irvine saying that you can actually predict people big five personality traits same personality traits that Cambridge Analytica were seeking to obtain from that Alexander Kogan personality survey. You can predict people big five personality traits based on their behaviour and click patterns alone, with 80% accuracy. This is important to understand, because in a way in the future there will be very little ability to hide who you are, what you are or your political beliefs friend of mine, Poppy Crum of Dolby, says this is  end of the poker face there are enough signals or signatures coming off your behaviour itself, based on how your eye movements work, your body language and your looks, that we can predict this information about you without you ever consenting to give it to me explicitly.  The dangerous thing in where this is going, and why I think some of the people I work with lose sleep with me sometimes that, because AI will allow you to predict things about human animals that they do not know about themselves, that can be used in dangerous ways if we do not protect against it.  A relevant question for regulation that someone might have asked Mark is: what are you willing not to learn about people? And what business model are you willing not to engage with that would override human agency? Because we have got human animals over here and we have got supercomputers pointed at them. Literally the biggest supercomputers in the world are inside two companies, Facebook and Google, and we have pointed those supercomputers at people brains to predict what will get them to do, think and feel things. That is a dangerous situation. We should have a new relationship with businesses that are based on that system. We could point AIs, artificial intelligence systems and supercomputers at climate change, drug discovery and solving problems, but I do not think we should be pointing them at human beings, especially not with the goal of selling access to that prediction and that ability to influence to a third party: the priest who sells access to the confession booth.  Q3172\\xa0 Paul Farrelly: I am conscious that we have been focusing on Facebook to the exclusion of everyone else. I want to come back to other companies and technology, but, staying on Facebook for a moment, their answer could be,  you get this for free delete your account.  I do not want to delete my account because I find it very nice to keep in touch with friends, but it was my choice to open it up to a wider audience for political reasons in that sense I have made a pact with the devil. To the limits of my technology, I have tried to make a conscious choice to get away from Facebook Messenger, and, having deleted the app, it will not allow me to do that. People are still contacting me, and I do not want them to contact me on Facebook Messenger. That seems to be one simple choice that Facebook could respect internally, but there seems to be no full escape. Are there any other simple choices that Facebook could grant to people, so that the individual level may then moderate the need for a policy response? Tristan Harris: It is a great question. Like you are saying, when you are a magician you are always offering people choices. Every choice looks like a free choice, but the way you have structured the menu means that you win no matter what they choose. Facebook and all tech companies are in a position where they want to structure the menu in a way that looks like you are making a free choice, where you don have to use it, you can just use Messenger. But if you use Messenger and you don let it track your location, for example, it will notify you and put a message on the screen each time saying,  allow us to track your location. They are always rearranging the menu, so that they will get access to the things that they want, which is more access to locations, more access to your contacts and giving you reasons to upload your contacts, so that you can invite your friends. I am speaking more in terms of the problem than solutions. I have not thought about how to divvy up Facebook in the same way. One example is that it used to allow you to do what you are talking about Facebook. You could tap  and then right from the web interface you could type a response back. Now they do not allow you to do that. They force you to download Messenger. One of the things that happened in the 1990s with AOL Instant Messenger think this happened through regulation that it was forced to become interoperable, so that you could use AOL Instant Messenger, which used to be a closed system under AOL system, with other messaging clients. You could imagine a world where there is more interoperability just data portability, but fundamental interoperability. I can take my phone number and say that I don want that number to be on AT&T or Sprint anymore, but I want to move it to Vodafone. With Facebook I can do that. I can take my entire group of friends and say that I want to move my ability to communicate with them and everything I have ever said with them in the past entire stack of stuff this other place. They theoretically let you click download on this very messy zip file that archives all of this information in this unusable format, but they don really make it interoperable in a clean way. If there was interoperability, there would be more competition and Facebook would be forced to improve its product, and there would be possible competitors that might be more ethically or humanely designed. I don have a clear answer for you in terms of how to split it up just at the moment.  Q3173\\xa0 Paul Farrelly: I just use that as one example of where the users or the product humans a choice to download an app for a particular feature, such as Messenger, and then make a choice to delete the app, because we don want to be contacted. In my case, I can be contacted by email, phone and face to face. With that feature, I find that people come from all directions and, in particular, do not know how to moderate their language when they are addressing you. I simply don want to use it. At the micro level, that is one example of where you try to make a choice, but the choice isn fully respected, so the only answer is the nuclear answer, which is just to delete the account. Tristan Harris: We call these all or nothing choices. You have to use the app and they do whatever they want to good example of this, going back to our previous discussion, is Snapchat. You cannot use Snapchat without them doing the streaks. You can flip a switch off and not do that. There is another example from Snapchat manipulative thing that they do. When your friend just starts to type to you the first two characters of a message, it actually buzzes into the other person phone interrupts the other person, the other kid  friend is starting to type to you, and it builds anticipation for that. Snapchat does not allow you to turn off that feature, at least it didn the last time I checked. In general we need much more accountability for these all or nothing choices. Frankly, that is something our organisation should be more on top of, but many more people should be looking at these agency-inhibiting or disempowering architectures. This is an area where more oversight and pressure needs to be made, especially when it comes to the more vulnerable populations, such as children. Q3174\\xa0 Paul Farrelly: Clearly the concern here is not just about political manipulation but about making these platforms a more enjoyable, safer and more responsible place for people to be. Politicians clearly cannot specify individual changes to individual models and algorithms, or whatever you call it. Do you see, overall, that the competition between these actors to maximise face time and eyeball contact is such that there will have to be a policy response, because everything that they will do will just be tinkering at the edge? Tristan Harris: One thing that just came to mind as we were just talking was having third-party reviews of metrics and things. We have this problem where there are not enough choices on the menu when people have real problems. Like you said, there are ways to rearrange or re-rank news feeds, which they are not doing themselves.  Right now there is a problem that, first, there is no transparency. We on the outside do not know how news feeds are ranked. There is also no accountability, so when we want to change them or we encounter a problem, there is no way to force them to do it. There could be a different system by which they are forced to have expert reviews with outside bodies. You have seen Facebook start to make that kind of change around elections recently, when they set up a research group.  I say this because there is a need for external oversight by trusted actors who can basically help them to make those choices. You can accommodate everyone choices, but some of this work will happen through forcing them to look at those things with outsiders. But again, like you said, so long as those outside changes might fundamentally inhibit their business model they would lose 30% of their revenue because it turns out that people don like spending so much time on the screen and would much prefer to spend that time in person; Facebook previously made that happen by prioritising Facebook events and in-person ways of being with each other will not do that, because its primary goal is still funded by the advertising business model. It comes back to regulation around the advertising business model and ways of making it easier for people to pay. By the way, there is a contradiction in their argument about it being elitist to suggest that people should pay for Facebook. People say, on the one hand,  dare someone say that people should pay for Facebook? That creates inequality in society while on the other hand they say that they are trying to build programmes so that people fund journalism and have subscriptions with different journalistic publications, which people should pay for. On the one hand they want Facebook to be free dare you say that it shouldn be free? on the other hand they say that people should pay for good-quality content.  Maybe it should be the other way around. People should get great journalism for free, because that has a deeper epistemic and positive impact on society, and maybe Facebook should cost money. I say that because the business model will always come up against the kinds of concerns that we are raising. Usually, the thing that is best for people would require a sacrifice in what is best for engagement, growth or time spent looking at the screen. Q3175\\xa0 Paul Farrelly: We access social media through hardware that runs on proprietary operating systems. You made some suggestions as to how the main companies in those fields might respond to and address this problem. Could you explain those to us? Tristan Harris: Thank you for bringing that up. One thing that everyone should know is that Apple and Google make the devices, not the apps kind of like the government of the attention economy. The US, UK or EU Governments don set up the rules for what apps can do or not do, or what business models apps can or cannot have. Apple and Google, who control the iOS App Store and the Play store, and the home screens and the programming interfaces and the rules, are like the government of the attention economy.  Think of it like a city. Apple and Google are the urban planners of that city, and they are funded by slightly different business models. One urban planner, Apple, is paid by you to live in that city. You pay Apple for a phone, and then you live in the Apple city. In the Google city, you pay them by searching for things and asking for things you specifically want, plus spending time in that city looking at things, so they are funded by advertising. Both Apple and Google are the governments or the urban planners of the attention economies that they govern.  Then there are no zoning laws. It is completely unregulated, so you could build casinos everywhere. It is not like you have a residential zone and a casino zone, or a commercial zone. It is that right next to your bedside table, you can build casinos, as loud as possible, and those casinos can be as manipulative as possible and there are no rules.  Apple and Google are in a position to impose, frankly much faster than world Governments, rules that include things like changing the default settings for notifications, or creating different zonal laws for communications applications and standard communication messenger. Snapchat, Facebook Messenger, iMessage and WeChat could be governed by specific different rules that involve communication, which are different from generic application rules. This is looking into the weeds a little bit, because these are more technical and design discussions, but the point is that they are the ones that are the rule-making bodies. They do not have a strong incentive to change the rules, except when there is large public pressure, as happened recently when Google announced its wellbeing initiative at Google I/O about two weeks ago, and hopefully what Apple will announce at WWDC coming up in about a month.  I am not sure if I am answering your question enough, but that is the kind of thing. Potentially, Governments can put pressure on Apple and Google to make those changes more urgently. They could, for example, change taxes. They could tax the advertising-based business model. They could say, if you are going to be an advertising-based business model in our store, you have to pay a certain amount of your revenue out. There are different ways to do that and there would be different issues that people would have with the way that they executed that, because it puts too much power in Apple and Google hands, but those are the kinds of things that I think are possible.  Paul Farrelly: Rather than delay us here, if you could possibly provide us amateur gardeners with a professional guide as to how to cope with the weeds, that would be really useful.  Tristan Harris: Sure.  Q3176\\xa0 Paul Farrelly: I presume that, having singled out Apple and Google, you might include other big players like Microsoft and Samsung in that as well.  Tristan Harris: That right. I am sorry; I didn meant to single out the others. Microsoft is also in a good position to do this. It is just that when you think about the mobile phone market specifically spent my time there and Google have such a dominant share of that market. But Microsoft and Samsung are also both in positions to do much more around this, and they have different sets of incentives that could be used to push them faster and further in the right direction.  The key thing is also future device factors. Whether that is eyeglasses or watches, these are devices that again are the governments of whatever occurs or shows up, or whatever the rules of competition for attention are. Right now, if you take conspiracy theories on YouTube, maybe there are more rules that say you cannot compete with conspiracy theories.  There are different places where moral authority is a sign that governance is happening. Right now YouTube is being forced to try to strip off some content, but Apple could be putting pressure on YouTube to do more. There are multiple layers of accountability that could happen, depending on how you see the problem.  Q3177\\xa0 Paul Farrelly: You mentioned the App Store and similar sorts of marketplaces. What problems do you see arising from how those sorts of downloads and purchases take place at the moment, and how might they be remedied?  Tristan Harris: This has been changing, a little bit as a result of the awareness that we have been driving. It used to be that app stores sorted what was at the top of the menu. They rewarded the top 10 or top 100 apps based on downloads, ratings and revenue. That produces an incentive. Let say you make it by downloads. Then what you want to do if you are an app developer is manipulate how many people download the product. You create growth-hacking invitation mechanisms that force users to invite 10 of their friends just to use the app, and that gets more downloads, and suddenly you are at the top of the app store. That is not a good way to incentivise them.  Instead, you could incentivise them based on time well spent, which is to say, minimal regret. What are the things that people find lastingly, durably valuable, and net positive when making positive changes in their lives? You would have a totally different set of winners and losers at the top of those app stores. I think Apple has been going a little bit in that direction, and those are some examples.  You could change the rankings; you could change how much Apple and Google tax the business models of the apps they are promoting if they are in an advertising or a freemium model, or if they are manipulating people with virtual currencies lot of the apps that make a lot of money right now are virtual games where people have to pay money to put virtual credit into the game, and their parents look at their credit card bill and suddenly it enormous. Apple can take a moral stance, a normative stance, and tax some of those business models with a preference for things that people find lastingly valuable, and align business so that people pay for a product in a way that is durable like subscriptions. The best way to solve the problem is to align incentives. When people pay for the ongoing benefits that they receive in a lasting way, like subscriptions, that is the most aligned business model that we know of right now. Q3178\\xa0 Jo Stevens: Thank you, Tristan, for your evidence and for joining us today. I was going to ask you questions about future regulation and what you would be recommending, but you have talked quite a lot about that so far. Picking up on your evidence, you said that we need a ban on micro-targeted advertising. We need legal reclassification of the platforms, whether that is a contract model or some other model, and you mentioned taxing the advertising-based business model. Are there any other recommendations that you would make on future regulation? Tristan Harris: That is a great question. The first one is a ban on micro-targeting or long-tail personalised advertising that things can be personalised to people although they will not know or realise that they are being personalised to. There is going back to a public form of impersonal advertising.  One thing that needs to happen are kind of working on this what we call the ledger of harms. It is basically identifying the economic externalities on society that come from these products. Think of it like a pollution tax. You price how much you are externalising harm into the balance sheets, so in the same way that we tax carbon at $40 per tonne, you can ask how much you are polluting the belief in truth environment. How much are you polluting the mental health environment? Based on the number of users who use your products, and the average cost of mental health issues that show up is about how we start putting a price tag on those externalised systems. Fundamentally, at a structural level, because of the finite amount of attention there is, I see this as an extraction-based economy. It is a win-lose economy. I am extracting attention out of society for profit and publicly harming. For a society to thrive, certain loops of attention have to exist. A parent has to be able to spend attention on their child; we have to spend attention on ourselves and in conversation with each other. We need to be present with each other. If attention does not go to those places, society would collapse: people do not believe in truth; kids do not get their developmental needs met those kinds of things.  Technology companies are pointing their attention extraction machines at human minds, and they are sucking the attention out of all the places where it used to go. In the same way, someone might see a tree as $10,000 worth of lumber, and they do not see all the complex ways that it is feeding the ecosystem because it is way more profitable simply to cut the tree down than it is to leave it there and realise its value in those other ways. Just like the Environmental Protection Agency, we might want to protect certain forms of attention where it needs to go, and tax places where we are harming those different parts of society.  That is an abstract answer to your question. There are ways of making it more concrete. We need further research, and we need economists to work on trying to name what some of those concrete costs are per platform. For example, YouTube drove 15 billion impressions to a popular conspiracy theory channel. We know that YouTube drove hundreds of millions of viewers to disturbing videos of children with the YouTube Kids app. If you can quantify those views took down those accounts and we don have transparent external access to how many people saw those videos.  Q3179\\xa0 Jo Stevens: That is the problem, isn it? Facebook is so secretive and does not have the level of transparency that is needed for the research to be done. In order to do the research you are talking about, wouldn they have to be forced to co-operate and disclose what is needed? Tristan Harris: Sorry, I am having problems with the audio quality, but I heard the last bit of what you said, about forcing them to co-operate. It would be great to be able to get these data points out of them and to force them to co-operate with getting that information out. For example, we had to bring them to Congress to know that Facebook had influenced 126 million Americans. We would not have got that number had we not brought them to Congress, because until then they claimed it was only 1 million or 2 million people. Similarly to Brexit, maybe there should be a fine for underestimating some of these costs.  Q3180\\xa0 Jo Stevens: What do you think the United States will do in terms of regulation? Do you have a feeling about what approach they will take? Tristan Harris: I don know. In some ways, we depend on Europe right now to lead the way. As you know, the United States is a little bit of a circus right now when it comes to governance, and we do not have agreement on the different sides. I think there is a power and antitrust issue, and there could be a case around that. I am not sure, though, that specific things will be done in the US now. In the same way that GDPR originated in Europe and they have led on privacy protections, this might be an area where Europe can continue to lead. I have a couple of other ideas to run by you. The first is more transparency for researchers. We should simply regulate so that there is more transparent access to trusted research groups. Right now, there is no way for outsiders to know what the living, breathing crime scene, as we like to call it, was with Brexit and the US elections in 2016. Only Facebook and Twitter have the data. In some cases, it has been released after a lot of external pressure, but we should force that access. Until they can fix these problems, which, as we know, are long-term issues, they should fund public awareness campaigns about the costs and harms of these problems and the fact that they cannot control what is true and what people see, in the same way that cigarette companies could be fined to fund the public awareness campaigns around cigarettes.  We need to deal with human impersonation. I do not know whether that should be done through fines, but we need to force companies to anticipate the impersonation of alternative identities. I could start an account called  right now and respond to a big tweet from the Associated Press. That just happened have evidence of it from a week ago. Twitter does nothing to take down these impersonations of accounts. Theoretically, people could thwart them, but they need to have a proactive responsibility, not a reactive one. That is one of the biggest problems: these companies do something, but they usually do it way too late. I don blame them is very hard. They are basically now accountable for impacting more than 180 countries in languages they cannot speak, but they have to be able to dedicate more resources to this. One way or another, we have to force them to dedicate more resources to these problems. Another thing is reinstituting a lot of the election protections that exist in different countries campaign advertising online, for example. In the United States, there was a 17:1 difference in the cost of election ads. Those are the kinds of things that I am worried about and some asks from a regulatory perspective. Q3181\\xa0 Giles Watling: A thought occurred to me when listening to Mr Farrelly questioning about Facebook. We hear about Cambridge Analytica harvesting data from Facebook. I am not on Facebook. Would Facebook be holding data on me? Tristan Harris: Yes. Q3182\\xa0 Giles Watling: And that is from other internet searches I do? Tristan Harris: Well, it is through, first, the fact that your name is showing up on other people posts in contexts that you do not control. They have that data whether they want it or not, and they associate it with other clusters of information whether they want to or not. Q3183\\xa0 Giles Watling: I am probably being quite dim, but I do not see what use my data could be to Facebook, if I am not using Facebook. How could they use it? Tristan Harris: How could they use it? It is a great question. I do not actually know the answer to that, because I do not know their practices. All I can say is that, as we all know, there are trackers on every website that we go to. Data is acquired from lots of different places. Sometimes Facebook acquires it, and there are also third-party independent trackers. You can be identified because your patterns of behaviour show up everywhere. Again, there are ways that other people who are on Facebook might reference you, and they could collect that information and you would not really have a say in that, because it would involve changing the speech of other people who are referencing you. What would it mean to protect your information in that case? That is one of the issues that we have to face. Q3184\\xa0 Giles Watling: It is kind of scary. One final thing: Tristan, do you think Mark Zuckerberg should appear before this Committee? Tristan Harris: I do think he should come before the Committee.  Q3185\\xa0 Chair: To go back to your call for a ban on micro-targeting users with advertising, in which specific ways would you introduce a policy such as that on to the Facebook platform? Tristan Harris: One other thing on Zuckerberg coming to your Committee, because I simply said  after 9/11, the CEOs of all the major airline companies in the United States appeared before Congress. Even though they were just the vehicles that had been used for a terrorist attack, they appeared before Congress. Even if social media platforms are just vehicles for massive influence campaigns that have geopolitical implications, it is clear now that in Brexit and the 2016 elections, there was a psychological attack on two countries in a certain way. Specifically in these circumstances, that would make it justified for Zuckerberg himself to appear, and there is precedent for that. But your question was about micro-targeted advertising. Q3186\\xa0 Chair: Yes, what would you do to introduce a policy such as that on to Facebook? Should certain tools be banned or disabled? For example, should there be restrictions on people loading custom audiences on to Facebook to target users individually? Would you ban Facebook Pixel from gathering data about users who visited sites off the platform so they can be targeted just for having visited those sites? I would be interested in your view on the implications of introducing a ban on micro-targeting. Tristan Harris: It is a really good question. As you said, there are multiple angles. There is the collection of micro-targeting data, the use of it on other websites, the use of it on Facebook custom audiences using that data on other websites and the Facebook advertising engine, which could have used it on Facebook audience selection process, which is how much you can select audiences, and then how much you can computationally generate 60,000 variations of an advertising message to test it on different people. That is part of the micro-targeting process fact that I am letting a supercomputer calculate for me the perfect words I should say to you to have you nod your head.  All those things are dangerous in different ways. We have said that one of the challenges is that I am not the person who runs the Facebook advertising team. The unfortunate situation is that the people who most know where the dangers are, are inside the company. The question is, how willing are they to examine where they do not have control over the platform there are circumstances where bad things can continue to happen, as they have been happening, in the Irish referendum and other places. They cannot control that.  It is important to note that Facebook decided acted to try to reduce some of the things that were happening in the Irish referendum, but Google, on YouTube, realised that it could not solve the problem, so it simply banned all ads about the Irish referendum altogether, because it realised that it was too complicated for it to solve the problem.  There is the model of Tylenol in the 1980s. There was a problem and the company said,  have to take our product off store shelves until we fix it. I think that we have to ask ourselves,  is a safe advertising environment? This is not about being naively anti-technology or anti-advertising; it is about asking,  is it contributing to the best possible social goods for society? For example, advertising is a great way for small businesses especially to grow. Many small businesses in the world would not exist if it were not for Facebook advertising. I think what we want to do is to find those safe examples business advertising and certain types of product advertising or marketplace out where this is working really well, and then slowly add back, brick by brick, the safe parts and make sure we are not including the dangerous parts. Right now, Facebook are taking the entirety of what they are doing and they are trying to chip off some of these edges and say,  we will make our advertising transparent. That is like saying,  a sugar company and we dosing the entire world with sugar, but now we have this programmatic interface, so people can try to figure out where all the sugar is going. We just do not want it to go to all those places in the first place; we have to be careful about where it is going. So I think that more than an approach of transparency, which is their current approach, we need to ask,  are the safe forms of advertising? Just a total micro-targeting ban might be too aggressive; maybe it does not have to be a total micro-targeting ban, but this is the conversation that needs to be had. Only Facebook have the deep inside information to know what the threats are and where they can build it back safely, but my deep concern is that they are in denial and think that they can retain the majority of their business model and the exponential benefits of long-tail targeting to any keyword, to any person, of any age, gender or whatever. Instead, they need to take a very conservative approach. That is what I most want them to do. Q3187\\xa0 Chair: Talking of that sort of conservative approach, do you think there would be a case for saying that political advertising should not be allowed in the news feed on Facebook? Tristan Harris: To be honest with you, I would not know whether that would be the thing that matters most, because you could say,  used to have more ads in the sidebar; now they have ads in the news feed. Obviously, there is the difference on mobile versus on desktop. These are complicated issues. I would love to come back to you when we have more specific ideas about what that could look like. Q3188\\xa0 Chair: One of the issues we covered with Mike Schroepfer, when he gave evidence to the Committee, was whether users should have the right to opt out of political advertising. At the moment, they can stop receiving it. Tristan Harris: We were discussing earlier whether it should be legal for priests to have the business model of selling access to the confession booth. I kind of think that is one of the situations on Facebook. However, if you take that approach, at the very least there should be such a thing as priests that allow you to pay them, as opposed to the current situation, where the only business model is for priests to sell access to the confession booth. That is kind of where we are now. At the very least, as you are saying, Facebook should have an option for you to pay not just not see the ads. That is what people miss about this conversation.  If it is pitched that way I am paying so the ads do not show up will say,  I don really mind the ads. In fact, Facebook will say that if you do a study, people actually prefer the version of Facebook the version of a newspaper or magazine has these big, beautiful, compelling ads in it; it makes it interesting. So the problem is not the advertisement; it is the fact that there is this unregulated automated system that is matching 2 billion people eyeballs to products that could be from anybody, and that includes divisive or incendiary speech that they cannot control. So what we are paying for is control. It is for safety. We are not paying to remove the ads completely; we are paying for a safer world. I think that, more than that being the voice of the individual, we want to create standards that raise the bar for everybody, and that is the challenge. I think this is very much like climate change. We have found this business model of advertising that is like coal. Coal is the most efficient way to get lots of energy at a really cheap cost. It propped up our economy for a long time, and that was great; we couldn have gotten here without it. Now, we need to invent, and we did invent, renewable energy alternatives. That was more complicated. It took more science, more math, more development, but we got the prices to shift. I think the same is true of advertising. Advertising is like coal. It is this cheap business model that was very efficient at generating a ton of money for a lot of people a handful of people. It has worked really, really well and it also is polluting the fabric of society because it tears the fabric of truth apart. It corrodes democracy; it corrodes the mental health of children. We now say,  we really happy we got to this point where we made all that money from advertising. Now we need to develop an alternative. The alternative will take ingenuity, social science, philosophy, ethics and a much more sensitive view of what it means to impact 2 billion people lives and the structure of people culture and society. I think that is where we are. We know where we came from. We are starting to wake up to how bad that was, and we have not yet invented the alternative business model that is just as economically profitable it may not be. That is kind of where we are. Q3189\\xa0 Chair: In the short term, a lot of our concern has been about political messaging disinformation being spread through political messaging, driven by advertising as the agent to disseminate it. We know that political advertising is a relatively small part of Facebook business. It is a relatively small part of the ad market. Do you think there would be a case now to say,  people don want to receive paid-for political messaging, they should at least be able to opt out of that, even if they can opt out of advertising on the platform in general. Tristan Harris: Were you saying that if people do not want political advertising they should be forced to not use the platform at all, or were you talking about carve-outs? Sorry, I missed Q3190\\xa0 Chair: No. Say you do not want to receive political advertising say you are a user who is worried about Russian fake news and other things that you might get you say,  want to opt of that. I want to change my settings so that no one can target me or send me political advertising. At the moment, you cannot do that, because Facebook can still sell you to an advertiser, and you cannot stop receiving it. Given that a lot of focus has been on this sort of disinformation, spread through advertising on Facebook, and the value of this is a relatively small part of Facebook advertising revenue, should we now, as a kind of first step, say,  do something about that, and at least let people have the option of turning that feature off if they don want to receive it. Tristan Harris: Instead of just giving you the option of it, why not just make it the default until we know that it is safe? Let just turn political advertising off altogether. That is where I would stand. I would say, though, that the challenge is that what Russia did, for example, was less about messaging to political keywords and instead just using the keywords that certain kinds of divisive groups would already use.  If I want to magnify conspiracy theories in your population, all I have to do is use completely non-political keywords, which are just the words that that conspiracy theory group use. I can just use the word  or something like that, and I suddenly have access to the anti-vaccines or  Moms I can access a group and start to stoke them in a certain direction. That is not political. One of the challenges is that this issue defies the normal labels and boundaries that would be convenient. It is exponentially complex territory in terms of the diversity of things that can be targeted against.  That is why I am saying that I think we have to be really careful about which areas of that landscape we want the switches to be turned on. You can advertise, for example, products and merchandise. Do we really need to enable anyone to simply put messages into people minds? Maybe there are safer ways to do it. I am hoping so.  Again, I think people inside Facebook have the most knowledge about what might be safe and what is not safe. That is one of the issues: transparency. From the outside, it is hard to make recommendations that they would not roll their eyes at. They would be right to roll their eyes at me, because I do not have access to the data. On the other hand, they are in denial because they want their business model. I think that is the real issue that we are in. Chair: That covers our questions. It has been really great talking to you again, and a really interesting session. Thank you very much.  \",\n",

The first is popularizing an all encompassing enemy to start a company, and the second is popularizing an all encompassing enemy to scale a company. So basically, everything I write here can be summarized as,  grow a company by popularizing an all encompassing enemy. Are people  enough to unite for something?

I give you a few examples, but this comes from my gut teams are built from a purpose for something, and not a purpose against something.

Now, 5 months ago it mostly implied the latter but which one is your company more likely to achieve? The math clearly indicates that a new company is more likely to be charged with sexual harassment than achieve a $50B evaluation by disrupting the long-standing social norm of not getting into a stranger car. The point is simpler. Who you are is not who you are not. Too often I see established companies say,  not like Y or  like Y, but we do Z. For established companies, this comparison is often done with a change in tone for when the competitor is mentioned. There nothing wrong with admitting similarity  if you honest about it. Internet accessibility is a great thing to offer. If it reliable, it works. Many of the products and services we pay for are like this  binary, meaning the granular improvement is negligible to the customer utility. There nothing wrong with many companies offering similar services; in fact, it should be the staple of capitalism: many companies willing to provide the goods and services that the population demands.

In reality, this is where the common enemy of the company becomes the customer. True product-market fit is more accurately described as  You may have played this game before.

Ultimately, if you go down the all encompassing enemy route, your goal is a monopoly, and the reality is, it might work as in, the tech conglomerate is fewer companies with more market share but you just may be the next Zuck.

       "  '(This is a republished blog from my failed startup, Mighty Spring, on the subject of Referral Hiring) A recent post on the First Round Capital blog promoted  hiring as the go-to form of talent sourcing for young companies and provided ammunition for generating greater numbers of referrals from existing employees.  It seemed obvious while reading this post that using the suggested tactics would improve raw referral numbers, but degrade referral quality. There was little mention of the introduction of misaligned incentives and the downside risks associated with those new incentives. Comments on the post from the popular startup community, Hacker News, seemed to indicate that many employees have an intuitive grasp of the ris;ks and incentive problems that come with trying to juice referral-based candidate lead generation  more so, perhaps, than employers who are narrowly focused on trying maximize their referral numbers. Today, with the help of comments from the Hacker News community on the aforementioned FRC post, we attempt to present a fuller picture of referral hiring. The Importance of Incentive-less Referrals Offering a referral bonus to employees for referring friends who get hired is common practice, but is it necessary? By offering bonuses in this way, companies essentially turn their employees into part-time contingency recruiters who now face the same bad incentives of their full-time counterparts. With $5,000 or more potentially on the line, a given employee is likely to be more lenient with their referral standards than if there were no financial reward at stake. Meanwhile, employees who truly love their jobs naturally gush about work and try to get their talented friends involved. In the Hacker News discussion, user Conorgil145 made a comment to this exact effect,  I love my job, then you better believe that all of my developer friends are going to hear about it until I am blue in the face. To drive a significant volume of meaningful referrals, focus on a feedback loop with your employees that address their root concerns \\xa0the reasons that they not already gushing to their talented friends about how much they love their company. If you want your employees to gush to their friends, ask them directly,  can we do as a company to improve the likelihood of you recommending us to those in your network as a place to work? Requesting referrals from employees who have fundamental concerns about their workplace lowers the likelihood of them referring their most talented friends. Instead, you likely to hear about their buddy who  needs a job Once you nipped the real issues in the bud, keep your hiring needs in the forefront of employees minds by mentioning them at regular intervals. Make your workplace somewhere people really do want to work, and the word of mouth will take care of itself. If you insist on using referral bonuses, consider tying them to the long-term success of the hire instead of positioning them as a quick buck. Fast cash actually lowers the standard of who your employees will refer. Try, for example, referrals bonuses (cash or equity) that vest based on the hire performance over the first year. Your Hiring Process (is a Problem) Companies don like to admit it, but many have hiring processes that treat candidates who are early in the hiring funnel as expendable, interchangeable, and disposable. This incentivizes employees to not refer their friends for fear of mistreatment. Angersock notes,   really annoying is when you try to bring in talented engineers from your network, and your company drops the ball: either by not getting in touch with them, or low-balling them, or refusing decent equity. If I referring somebody from my network to you, I want to make sure you treat them well and with promptness them is a sign of disrespect to me as well, and makes me look like an ass to them.  It doesn take much to turn a good candidate off with your hiring process. Slow contact at important junctures, overly-vague explanations of how the hiring process works, what to expect from a given interviewer, and poor transparency into decision making criteria are all big annoyances for candidates (though most companies consider them to be a given in hiring).  In a world where  the best, no questions is considered foundational behavior for success, isn your hiring process your most important product? What if the only product your company produced was your hiring process? How would it change from your approach today? First impressions don fade easily. You may get a candidate who has been through a poor hiring process to accept an offer, but they remember how they were treated. Even if they chalk their experience up to chance, they still may still be concerned about subjecting their friends to the same treatment. The Hacker News crowd expounds on the troubles with the middle of the hiring funnel, and the resulting effects: Tptacek writes,   sense of it is that the valley believes recruiting to be a  of the funnel problem. My experience says that it isn My hypothesis is that the inefficiency is in qualifying candidates (deeper in the funnel), and that if you can fix that problem, the top of the funnel can sort itself out without much effort. InclinedPlane writes,   seen too many examples of poor interviewing process, too many bad hires made, and too many good hires passed over to not put most of the onus on the middle of the funnel. Most interviewers are just not good at understanding the fragility of the process, or in having sufficient empathy to understand the difficulty of getting good data on a candidate. From GVIrish,   putting all of my contacts in the hands of the HR dept I no longer have any control over how or when the company contacts them. That company can easily break the trust I have with my contacts. I wouldn be comfortable doing that, referral bonus or no referral bonus. Proxies Will Fail You Referral hiring can seem like a panacea, especially compared to low conversion rates from alternatives, but that attitude masks the real problem: you likely bad at evaluating cold leads. Like focusing on candidates from top-tier schools, seeking out friends of existing employees is nothing more than a proxy for independently-determined quality. This approach leaves you with an insulated pool of candidates, and a statistical evaluation will tell you that focusing too narrowly on referrals virtually assures that you missing out on the best talent in the market. Tptacek points out the dangers here:   hiring unavoidably personalizes the hiring process: candidates come in the door with sponsors. It hard to hire objectively, staying as close to apple-apples as possible, when your candidates are friends of employees who have significant bonuses riding on the selection. If You Want More Referrals, Align Incentives For Success Consider paying for your employees contact lists, not the hires that come from them. By doing so, you put the incentive to conduct a high-quality and thorough interview process on the people doing the hiring. Traditional recruiting fee structures are broken and standard employee referral fees are an equally broken extension of that model. Poorly-aligned incentives are ultimately bad for you, the company, even though they look like they reduce risk in the short term. A better, more efficient hiring funnel will provide outsized returns over many, many hires, and aligning incentives in candidate sourcing is the best thing you can do to jumpstart the necessary change. Colliding Worlds Right now companies are only asking to mine your LinkedIn and Facebook connections. But what next? Does anyone want to connect their Snapchat account? Soon they want family trees and the posts from your Secret account. From edandersen on the subject,   personal network is not yours to  If an HR person at my company contacts a friend of mine to pitch a job at the company I work at, trying to use my name as an  that is seriously unprofessional. More from pnathan:   not going to want to sit down with you and let you chew through my social networks for recruiting leads. Conclusion Well-executed referral hiring has exceptional value, but not all referral hiring is well-executed. Incentivized referrals have inherent risk, and pressing current employees to offer up a marginal referral potentially alienates the referrer and likely generates a worse-fitting candidate than one who is organically recommended. If you like to augment your current candidate acquisition efforts with high-quality, non-referral-based leads, check out Mighty Spring. We provide a curated short-list of candidates who are both qualified for, and interested in, your company open job. TL;DR:Optimize your hiring process and candidate lead generation strategy end-to-end with referrals as one element. Consider ways to drive referrals that are not based in financial incentives. If you must use financial incentives, align them with long-term organizational goals. Use Mighty Spring as another way to see great candidates :)',\n",
